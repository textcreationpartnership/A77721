            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>He was for Countrey and Quality a <hi>Grecian</hi> of Regal Extraction; and having as he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived been more hardly dealt with by Women than his innocence deſerved, and experimenting the dangers that reſult from Converſe with that Sex, yea even from the moſt vertuous of them, though not alwayes through their fault; He, in charity to <hi>bold</hi> and <hi>unheedy Youth,</hi> who are moſt obnoxious to their Malignity, deſired his friend <hi>Philiternus</hi> to commit his Life to Writing, and commend it to their Obſervation.</p>
            <p>Which Injunction <hi>Philiternus</hi> faithfully diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged by Penning this Relation in the <hi>Greek</hi>

            <p>But about ſix years ſince, not hearing by any means of his loſt papers, (as if all conſpired to make this work abſolute) he, in his Maturer years, again re-aſſum'd his Reſolution of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing this deſign; and, as he obtain'd leaſure from more urgent Affairs, out of the few Notes he had left, compleated this Diſcourſe; wherein

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He day had already began to dawn upon the Mountains tops, when getting out of the poor Lodging wherein I had paſt the precedent night with reaſonable tranquillity, I began my journey; and the Sun had not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed ſo far as to make a full diſcloſure of his face to mortals, when finding my ſelf at the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance of a very ſpacious Forreſt, into which my Horſe thruſt himſelf, and through abſtruſe and diſconſolate tracks, penetrated into its moſt ſecret retirements, I ſet my ſelf in the heat of that illuſtrious Planet's Meridian-rayes, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the leavey-ſhade of a lofty Platan, to repoſe me near the pleaſant murmure of a little rive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:170451:10"/>which, dilated into ſundry windings, ſought to empty it ſelf into a River, with which the Forreſt was in a manner wholly inviron'd. It was not long that I had there ſate, before the pleaſant whiſperings of the Aire and Brook had reconciled my eyes to ſleep, and that I made my head to lean on the Root of that Platan; and ſcarce had I given up my brows to a languid ſlumber, when ſleep repreſented to me the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of a young Lady. I fancied, that with a behaviour ſufficiently obleiging, ſhe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of me my name, quality, and the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of my journey: But I not having (oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by an unuſual lethargy) knowledge, or power to find words to ſatisfie her demand; the Apparition, offended at my fatal taciturnity, ſmote me on the breaſt with a Serpent: Thus, ſaith ſhe ſhall I be ſure to know who thou art; and ſuddenly diſappear'd. I by this time awaking with a lowd cry, found my heart perplex'd by a cruel paſſion, and my face no leſſe covered with tears than with ſweat. Having there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore depoſed the muddineſſe of my face in the clearneſſe of the water, and forded the delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full rivolet, I felt my paſſions augmented to that heighth, that they oppreſs'd my ſpirit, and equally ſet at liberty the reins of my Horſe, and thoſe of my Reaſon; nor took I any other food then what my griefs adminiſtred, to whoſe mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy fortune had abandoned me. Thence, juſt at the time that Sol, leaving the lowneſſe of the Valleys, retreated his rayes to the tops of the Hills, I came into a place that had an Aſcent; from which there repreſented it ſelf to my eye
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:170451:10"/>the proſpect of a great Plain, in form of an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificial Theater, which, incircled on every ſide by the Forreſt, dignified its Center with a ſtately Pallace, berounded with a well proportioned fronte of little Cypreſſes, which expected the favour of time, to increaſe with their umbrage the melancholineſſe of that Seat; which, covered with black Marble, made a fair but mournfull diſcloſure of its Grandure. I therefore fix'd my eye full of admiration upon that ſtrange Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice; and whil'ſt the curioſity to know the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of ſo lugubrious a place, led me out of my former track; I ſaw iſſue out of the oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite part of the wood, a Troup of men, which in the ſadneſſe of their habits, and langour of their deportment, declared themſelves very much grieved. There went before this compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny a Knight, who by his own appearance, and by the Garb of his followers might be preſumed Lord of the reſt, as, with his ſighs, and the abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of his tears he made himſelf believ'd more then all others afflicted. He breathed from his pale and meager face a moſt lamentable penſive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, which tormented the hearts of the behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, ſo much the more forcibly, by how much the more unſuteable ſo mournfull a look ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to ſo courteous an aire. In the mean time the melancholy Knight, drawing near to the place where I, for the unexpectedneſſe of the incounter, had made a halt, and raiſing his eyes to ſteal a look; he diſcover'd me: although at the firſt accoſt he appear'd ſomewhat mov'd, yet with a gracefull ſmile he clear'd up the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt of his face, conſtraining me with a ſweet
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:170451:11"/>violence, to take, in his Heremetical habitation, a ſhort repoſe. Thereupon, taking me by the hand, he conducted me with a very ſlow pace towards the gates of his houſe; over which I, who being a ſtranger made curious obſervations of the things of the place, ſaw a gilded ſcroul, in which with black Characters was ingraven theſe words:
<q>
                  <l>O man! that chance, or curioſity,</l>
                  <l>Hath drawn this moſt unhappy lodge to view,</l>
                  <l>Know 'tis own'd by ſuch who onely death perſue,</l>
                  <l>And, (dying every moment,) cannot dye.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Having with mine eyes run over, and with my mind lightly conſidered theſe Verſes, we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into that diſconſolate Manſion, wherein all things repreſented objects of heavineſſe and grief; ſince the Hall and Chambers, hung onely with black furniture, wrought in the heart a ſad melancholy, which almoſt bereaving a man of himſelf, in deſpight of all he could do did conſtrain him to ſhed tears. Over the Nieces of the doors of each room, there hung after the uſe of <hi>Italy</hi> ſeveral goodly pictures, but in as much as the repreſentation that they made of Tragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Loves, did in a great meaſure impair their delightfulneſſe; the eye might not be fix'd on them, without the prejudice of the mind, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended by the ſtrange ſight of thoſe miſerable occurrences. Being left for a little ſpace by the courteous Knight, to repoſe my body in a Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber leſſe-ſadly furniſhed, he returned himſelf in perſon to invite me to Supper, which by reaſon
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:170451:11"/>of the hot ſeaſon I found was prepared with real Magnificence in a very ſpacious Hall; where no ſooner arriv'd, but carually caſting my eyes on the Walls I there obſerved, covered by a thin Vail, a Magnificent picture, in which I diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered depainted a young Lady, whoſe face ſeem'd to be deſcended to inform the Graces with all the proportions requiſite to render it a breathing picture of beauty. Her complexion did onely mourn with dolorous appearance: a Vermillion ſtream of bloud, which trickling from her breaſt, transfixed by a little Dagger, ran to ſtain with mournfull drops her Attire. I was juſt about to vent by my mouth in words the curioſity of my mind to know what this picture did ſignifie, when it entred ſuddenly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to my thoughts, that perhaps from her took birth the deplorable cauſe, which held that houſe buried in ſo profound a ſilence. Yet by that modeſt reſpect which ought to regulate the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of men well-deſcended, in another man's houſe, I refrained for that time to ſatisfie my curioſity, and ſate down at Table with the Knight, where, beſides the ſingularity and abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of the cheer, I admired the marvelous or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the ſervice, proper to a great Prince.</p>
            <p>Supper being ended, and finding the time con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient, I introduced a modeſt diſcourſe tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the ſatisfaction of my deſires; with which I ſo mov'd the Knight, that he gave me no an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer but in theſe few words. Pacify you firſt the Ghoſt of <hi>Beliſa</hi> with acquainting me Who you be, and the occaſion of your journey; and then I will likewiſe to morrow (it being now
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:170451:12"/>time that you retire to your repoſe) ſatisfie your curioſity. I obeyed him, but not without occaſioning in him ſtrange aſtoniſhment at ſo unwonted adventures. And the Knight aſſert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a fatal neceſſity in his requeſt, entertained me a ſhort ſpace in ſuperfluous Complements of excuſe, but not with ſuperfluous Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of his incomparable generoſity.</p>
            <p>Performing therefore the injunction of the Knight, he withdrew with a diſcompoſed coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance into his Lodging, and I alſo was, with treatments of ſingular courteſie, attended and ſerved, in the apartment prepared for me. There at laſt being left alone, I went to bed, aſſaulted by various thoughts, occaſioned in me partly by the things I had heard, and partly by thoſe which I did expect to hear the next day: and that which did not a little foment my inquietude, was, the reverberated memory of my abſence from that perſon, which being more dear to me then my own life, I ſhall ſooner want a Soul in my breaſt, then ſuffer my love to diminiſh in the leaſt. Yet in the end wearied with long watching, I lightly accommodated my eyes to repoſe: but ſcarce had ſleep diſtended his pleaſant wings over my ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, when, firſt by a ſoft murmure gently ſtruck and warbled, and after by a lamentable Muſick, I was ſo awakened, that it was impoſſible for me in all that diſmal night to receive the ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes of <hi>Lethe.</hi> Thereupon I gave my ſelf to hearken if I could know what ſo lugubrious a ſong might intend, in ſo late an hour; and knew in the end that the Knight my Hoſt was the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy occaſion of that lachtimous ditty; af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicting
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:170451:12"/>himſelf in renewing the rewfull me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of his misfortunes, accompanied in this ſad office by his ſervants, who, too tender in the affects of their Maſter, did increaſe with their vain plaints that grief, which they ought rather with mature prudence to have tempered. So long was the mournfull harmony of thoſe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cturnal ſacrifices, that I at laſt more moved by wearineſſes than pity, deſired nothing elſe but only that the Sun, diſſipator of vain phantaſms, which in the night obnubilate the phancies of mortals, would riſe and illuminate the hemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſphear; and already it (become compaſſionate of my wailing) almoſt began to dart the Horizon with his rayes: When the Knight entering in ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly and domeſtically into my Room, invited me to be a ſpectator of the Divine Ceremonies, which in a little Temple adjoyning to his Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace he did celebrate. Being come thither, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted no leſſe ſtupified with the richneſſe of that edifice, which in the conciſeneſſe of its Gyre emulated the ſumptuoſity of the moſt renown'd Temples of the World; than with the ſingulari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of its Architecture, which ſeemed to have diſ-embowelled it ſelf to render it a miracle of Art. This admirable Chappel was, in the exteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our circuit, of a ſpherical figure, berounded with Columnes of black Marble, upon Pedeſtals of braſſe, and with Chapters, and Arches of the ſame matter marvelouſly wrought. In the ſpaces be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Columnes, and over the Arches, which ſupported a front of double Corniſhes, there was placed, in proportionate diſtances, ſundry Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, Hiſtorical and Fabulou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, ſome of Porphyr,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:170451:13"/>others of Allablaſter and Braſſe: but the ſummity of the roof, wrought with Marquetry into little foliages of Marble, incloſed a great Statue which by its aged face, by its wings disjointed from the ſhoulders, and by a dyal put in his right hand, repreſented an Image of the Temple. On the Weſt-ſide, was ſituate the Magnificent and lofty Gate by which men enter to Worſhip; in whoſe proſpect towards the Eaſt, did glitter an emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Altar of pureſt Marble, inchaſed with moſt precious Jemms; and ſuch, and ſo much was the ſplendor, which from the Carbuncles, Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolytes, and Cryſtals did beam forth, that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the help of windows, which might impart the rayes of the Sun, it ſufficiently illuminated that religious dwelling of the Divinity. On the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther parts South and North, hung in equal pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion two exceeding large pictures, leſſe rich indeed in Jewels than the Altar; but frauded perhaps with greater cunning, ſince it ſeemed (to who intentively beheld them) that the Painter and the Carver had ſtrove in formalities to give the World a marvelous exceſſe of Art; ſo excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently were diſcovered the draughts of the pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, in giving life to the tele; and ſo rarely were impreſt the touches of the chizel in inlivning the Marbles, that they ſerved as an Ornament to the tele. The Walls were covered with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding black &amp; ſplendid jet, and the pavements did even ſhine with the black Marbles which were laid upon them. In this noble Chappel was erected, more than two foot above the floor, a Sepulcher of polite Alablaſter finely hiſtorified with divers impreſſes of Love, bordered and gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:170451:13"/>with little leaves of Myrtle and Cypreſſe: about which with Greek Letters, which did ſeem juſt then dictated by a penſive Amoriſt, his Pen being placed upon the laſt Character, with a grace able to inchant Souls; was read theſe verſes.</p>

            <p>Now, whil'ſt the Prieſts went about with Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Rites, and pious Oblations to appeaſe the anger of the offended Divinity; I ſometimes ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered the curioſity of my eyes to wander after the guidance of fancy about the things, which there within did offer themſelves to the mind to be conſidered: and with ſo much the more inquie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, by how much, through the ſmall know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge I drew from thence, the deſire of behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them came to foment. The Divine functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons ended, the Knight, after having augurated to me that day to be happy, took me by the hand and led me out of the Temple, diſmiſſing the people which did follow him, and carried me all alone through a narrow path into the Forreſt; juſt where a little Mountain dividing it ſelf into three equal parts, did form with natural plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures the proſpect of a delightfull Theater. There did iſſue from its foot a tranſparent rivolet; but ſo ſcant at that time of water, that it did reveal to the negligence of the eye, all the ſecrets of its bottom. There were ſeen through thoſe freſh ſtreams little fiſhes to ſport themſelves among the candid pebles. But about the moiſtned banks
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:170451:14"/>did grow as in well ordered knots, a hundred va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieties of odoriferous Herbs, embroidered with a thouſand ſorts of flowers, which opening as it were their breaſts to the ruddy morning, did emit the aire of ſo delicate a perfume, that it had power to efface in great part from my heart the annoyance, which through the paſt waking, and through the dolefulneſſe of the things which I ſaw, was there ſo deeply rooted. The back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide of the Tripartite hill overſpread with Oaks and Pines, by nature diſperſed and diſpoſed with a negligent art, did overſhadow ſome very green Meadows, which in the middle of the Forreſt, haply through the benefit of the neighbouring Brook, renouncing to the commerce of the plants, did conſerve in their pleaſant largeneſſe the roots of the flowers inviolate. In one of theſe the Knight ſat down, and I placing my ſelf over againſt him, after many ſighs in a languiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and ſad tone, he gave beginning to his Narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion after this manner. From the firſt Original, which it may be you will not believe, I muſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive to you, moſt dear gueſt, the dolorous relation of my uncomfortable diſadventures: and though the mind abhorreth the remembrance of paſt griefs; yet becauſe notwithſtanding cuſtom hath converted grief into nature, I ſhall fully make relation of as much as I ſhall think neceſſary, that you may be able another day to manifeſt to the World the cruelty of a woman, and the dyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſters of a Lover abuſed. I was born <hi>(Philiternus)</hi> in the famous Citie of <hi>Thebes,</hi> Queen of <hi>Boetia,</hi> of a ſtock both generous, and nearly-allied to the Royal family, with replicated bonds of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſanguinity;
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:170451:14"/>and from my birth had given me the name of <hi>Arnaldo</hi> (for thus my father was called himſelf: a Knight no leſſe renowned in the Counſels of State then in the matters of War). Being grown to boy's eſtate, the puiſſant King <hi>Agenor</hi> my Uncle would have me dwell in his Court, to be brought up in the noble Company of his ſons, whence I learnt in a little ſpace the qualities convenient to a Knight of great birth; nor did I indure much labour to attain to the higheſt Dignities of the Court and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; nor was I envied (if it be lawfull for me to ſay it) by any; having preobliged the affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of all hearts, with the affability of my manners, with the complacency of my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, and the profuſeneſſe of my riches: I obtained in gift from Heaven a Wit, greater then my Fortune. Now it befell for my fatal diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe that I being with the Court in <hi>Thebes,</hi> there paſs'd from this life to a better <hi>Oſiander,</hi> a princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Knight and well deſerving from the Crown; whoſe obſequies the King himſelf was pleaſed to honour with his preſence, with all the flower of the Nobility of his Kingdom. Oh that do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorous Dagger wounded me to the very heart, with the mournfull remembrance of that moſt unfortunate day! Among the other friends of the defunct Cavalier, which aſſiſted at his Funeral, there was a young Lady his daughter, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides her being very beautifull of face, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placential of deportment, with ſo pitifull a deje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctedneſſe did bewail the death of her father, that each circumſtance in the Ocean of thoſe tears made ſhipwrack of a heart. She had diſordered
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:170451:15"/>with her tender hands her ſilver treſſes, whence one part of them deſcending on her ſhoulders, in precious Rings did incatenate the mind of the Spectators in ſtupor of her extream beauty: the other but ill retained by her hair-laces ran to bathe themſelves in the dolefull floud of ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, which overran the face, ambitious perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture to inrich with Pearls the nudity of their Gold. Thence her amiable face appeared a Sun which aroſe from the Sea with locks moiſtened with celeſtial Dew, and even had uſurped the property of the riſing Sun, whil'ſt that fair face obfuſcated by the Clouds of perplexity ſuffered it ſelf to be ſeen without offence of the behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, whereas in the noon-tide of cheerfulneſs there was no eye ſo firm as to be able to ſuſtain without peril of blindneſs the reflexion of its ſplendors. As ſoon as on this prodigious Creature I fix'd my looks, I preſently felt a fatal ſhivering to ſeiſe my Soul, which calling my bloud to the ſuccour of my heart, left my face overcaſt with a mortal paleneſs. And well might it be that he ſeemed dead, from whom one onely look of <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinda</hi> had raviſhed his Soul: Fair <hi>Lucinda</hi> was ſhe called, who was the happy cauſe of all my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plorable unhappineſs. I deſired really to fly from that perilous ſight; my mind being deſirous to avoid the mortal danger which I foreſaw; but Pity, a chaſte companion that never ſeparates from Love, recalled me to compaſſionate the grief of the weeping Damſel, by little and little introducing into my mind, and impreſſing in my heart thoſe languiſhing beauties of which they finally became an Idolater, though they be
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:170451:15"/>now reduced to aſhes; the ſparks of my love live notwithſtanding, and ſhall live perpetually buried in thoſe Cinders.</p>
            <p>That magnificent Funeral being ended, and having waited upon the King back to his lodging, I incontinent returned to that Temple, in which I had left my Soul depoſited under the credit of <hi>Lucinda</hi>'s beauty; and Love was for my misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune ſo courteous, that I had an opportunity of incountring her, whil'ſt among the ſad troup of her Allies ſhe returned to the forſaken houſe of her father; into which being entred ſhe carried with her, and included between thoſe bleſsed Walls, my perplexed ſpirit: whereupon remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing almoſt an exanimate Carkaſs, I withdrew my ſelf with a ſlow pace to my houſe, without knowing where I was, or whither I went: but onely that the privation of my ſpirit, tranſmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grated into the object beloved, made me with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iterated ſtingings to know, that yet I remained without a Soul in the World of the living. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing come there, I withdrew, with the violent companion of my new thoughts, from the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation of my familiars; conceiting (unexpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced that I was) to find in ſolitude a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort for my pain: but it did the more foment it; and I perceived in the end, that retiredneſſe from the commerce of people, wrought no other in me than a perplexing multitude of torments. Sleep &amp; Appetite to food forthwith left me; and ſeeing my ſelf loſt in a Love upon my own ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, without hope, I began wholly to abandon the care of my health: So that in a few dayes I ſeemed wholly altered from my ſelf in the eyes
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:170451:16"/>of the world. I ſometimes attempted to ſuppreſſe that fervent amorous paſſion, which did afflict me; but the more I forced my ſelf to conceal it, the more invigorating it ſelf, did it blaze out with greater impetuoſity: whence, my malady continually increaſing I ſaw my ſelf in a little ſpace reduced miſerably to periſh in the arms of melancholy and deſperation. But Neceſſity, the diſcreet inventer of healthfull contrivances, would have me live for my hurt, ſuggeſting to me that I ought not utterly deſpair of my health: ſince that, though the ſight of and ſpeech to <hi>Lucinda</hi> was not by fortune permitted me; I might notwithſtanding eaſily be able to pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate her meaning, finding among my Pages a youth which by being formerly a ſervant to her father, had acceſſe to the houſe with much liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and without ſuſpition. Whereupon I made known to him more with tears, which unawares betrayed my conſtancy, then with words, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal grief of my heart, and I deſired him he would follow his wonted viſits more frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; and report to me what he could diſcover of the perſon and wit of <hi>Lucinda.</hi> The Page obeyed me with ſufficient diſcretion and modeſty; and obſerving for ſome time what ſeemed to him op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portune to my intereſts, he thruſt me on finally with his perſwaſions, to write a Letter to my fair Enemy in this manner.</p>
            <floatingText type="letter" xml:lang="eng">
               <body>

            <p>Having written this Letter &amp; conſigned it to <hi>Diffilus</hi> the Page, and inſtructed him in the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner with which he ſhould tranſact the meſsage to <hi>Lucinda,</hi> I retired into the ſolitude of my Cloſet, ſtrongly aſsaulted by fear and hope to expect the iſsue. <hi>Diffilus</hi> went, and by good for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune obſerved that <hi>Lucinda</hi> accompanied by a Girle her ſlave, was buſied about her feminine imployments; he ſuddenly accoſted her, giving her my Letter, intreating her to receive it. But ſhe preſently clouded her face, to which the mind imparted the ſudden motions of its diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure; and beholding him with a fierce look commanded him preſently to get himſelf out of her ſight, and never dare to do the like to her, as he tendered his life. But the cunning Groom that knew the anger of a beautifull woman to be juſt like the ſtop of a Noble Courſer, not a jot affrighted by thoſe angry appearances, multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied his intreaties with no leſſe affection than diſcretion: whereupon <hi>Lucinda</hi> ſeeing her ſelf importuned with ſo much prudence, and being unwilling to yield to ſo affectionate an aſſault, aroſe to retire into ſome more private room, where it was not permitted <hi>Diffilus</hi> to follow her. Whence he perceiving of her intention, juſt as ſhe was riſing up to depart, caſt the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:170451:17"/>into her boſom with ſo civil a behaviour, that ſhe was neceſſitated to take it. An unhappy ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity for me; ſince as if it had been a Viper ſhe preſently tore it, reducing it to ſmoak and aſhes.</p>
            <p>This unhappy accident, related to me by the Page, gave me eaſily to underſtand what I might expect from this my unfortunate Love. My tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments therefore did in ſuch manner increaſe, that I eſteemed nothing but death able to deliver me. Thence I became ſo much an Enemy to my ſelf, that my pain, become familiar to me, left me to fall irrecoverably into a Gulf of deſperate thoughts; among which miſerably conſuming my dayes, there came to me one morning <hi>Diffilus,</hi> a curious obſerver of the actions of <hi>Lucinda,</hi> to tell me ſhe would be the following night in an adja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Temple, to celebrate the rites of a grand ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity: It ran in my mind that I might perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture be able (hid amongſt the nocturnal um<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brages, and covered with womans apparel) to weave a pleaſant ſnare for my proud enemy; from which if I ſhould get no other, I ſhould at leaſt with diſcourſe in ſome part vent my grief, and perhaps that Love would ſecond with greater ſucceſſe the lively force of my words, than he had done the dead Characters of my Letter. This propoſition being reſolved on, and the night de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired being come, I dreſt my ſelf in a ſute of <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſa</hi> my ſiſter, and with the onely attendance of <hi>Diffilus,</hi> who in like manner habited did conduct me into the Temple; and juſt in the place where he knew <hi>Lucinda</hi> would ſit, he placed me. And though the tenderneſſe of my age, which then ſcarce paſſing the eighteenth year, had not yet
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:170451:18"/>covered my face with the firſt down; and the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain twilight, which in the nocturnal dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſſe the burning Tapers formed, did exceedingly favour our deſign: I kept nevertheleſſe with pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text of the coldneſſe of the winter-ſeaſon my face covered with a Vail, to avoid the curioſity of the eyes of them, who frequent the Temple for no other end, than with their looks to lay ſiege to Ladies. Scarce was I ſetled in that place, when <hi>Lucinda</hi> appeared accompanied with ſo numerous a train of ſervants, that I e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed it a thing almoſt hopeleſſe to get any occaſion to ſpeak to her. Now while ſhe was approaching to my ſeat, me-thought that my heart skipping within me, would have leapt out of my breaſt; and they that at that time had ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved my face would have judged me mortally wounded; it was at that inſtant overſpread with ſo ſtrange a paleneſſe. Yet in the end <hi>Lucinda</hi> was come cloſe to me, and by the ſingularity of my dreſſe and deportment, believing me to be a Lady of great quality; courteouſly ſaluting me, ſhe ſate down cloſe by me: But what I anſwered to her civil Salute, I cannot remember; my ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits being at that time loſt in conſideration of the preſence of her, who was the ſole cauſe of all my enthuſiaſms, ſo that they were diſabled to all external functions. Yet recollecting by little and little my baniſhed forces, more by the benefit of the nights obſcurity than by any violence I knew how to offer on my ſelf; being aſſiſted alſo by the ſollitude in which <hi>Lucinda</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained (the croud of her ſervants being with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn into ſeveral parts of the Temple) I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:170451:18"/>plainly in this manner to expreſſe my mind.</p>
            <p>Dear <hi>Lucinda,</hi> if Fortune ſhall but grant me as much ability to expreſſe my torments, as you have power to make me feel them; I ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute my ſelf no leſſe fortunate then you be fair. It will therefore concern your affability not to regard the confuſion of my ſpeeches, but to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the afflictions of my heart, that compels me to pronounce them. I know not, courteous Madam, what profit you can expect from my ruin; nor what good you can extract from my evil. The tearing of my Letter was truely an impetuous motion of an offended mind: but the continual rending of my heart can be impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to no leſſe then an exceſs of cruelty. If this agree to a beautifull Lady, I leave you your ſelf to judge. And what excuſe can you find that may ſtand you inſtead to defend the ſeverity of your treatment towards him, who loves you above his own life, or rather that as to his Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rene Goddeſs, conſecrateth upon the Altar of his fidelity, his heart in a perpetual <hi>Holocauſt?</hi> You might eaſily, Madam, openly diſcover in my languiſhing looks what be the torments occaſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned no leſs by your beauty then by your rigour: and yet the ſuffering them grieves me not a jot, I am onely diſpleaſed that you are not pleaſed to accept my ſufference; Sweeten, I implore you, with the drop of ſome favour the bitterneſs of ſuch ſeverity: for that Lady ſpots not the can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor of her honeſty, which with a ſingle ſyllable of courteſie favours the affects of a noble Cava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier her Adorer. Other favour, Madam, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:170451:19"/>not of you than verbal. It ſufficeth me you be ſtill ſerved by honouring me with the Title of your Slave, and ſome declaration that my ſervices are not indifferent to you; bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing me now and then with a compaſſionate look. It's but a poor word, it's but a tranſient glance to one, whom it may recal from death to life.</p>
            <p>Thus proceeded I with a languiſhing voice, intermingling my prayers with my tears: But <hi>Lucinda</hi> (I believe that indignation would not permit her before, to reply) when ſhe perceived me thus run on, with a trembling and diſcompo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed voice (a ſign of great agitation of ſpirit) thus interrupted me.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Arnaldo,</hi> I anſwer at this time to your propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions to the end you deceive not your ſelf in the judgement you may paſſe upon my intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and leſt perhaps preſuming upon my ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, you may not nouriſh ſome fallacious hope to your prejudice and my own diſhonour. I ſhall know of a truth that you love me, if with deſiſting from your unadviſed enterprize you will ceaſe to trouble me. It is not for me to teach you what means you ſhould uſe to cure this amorous infirmity: but if you be but as diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet in your deſires, as with your ſighs you pretend to make me believe you are paſsionate; you would be able of your ſelf to inveſtigate the ſame.</p>
            <p>I uſe not to you that tigour which I ought, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I reverence your birth; but provoke me not in coming in this form, for you ſhall draw with ſecurity little ſatisfaction from your bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:170451:19"/>Conſider therefore, and remember that deceivers are wont to fall into the Nets of the deceits they intended for others.</p>
            <p>This anſwer of <hi>Lucinda</hi> was like Oyl, which, powred upon my burning heart, made the flame of my dolours to ſoment the more, ſince the more her words diminiſhed my hope, the more they increaſed my deſire of poſſeſſing her. Thence by conſidering the Divine beauty of her countenance, and by hearkning to the grace of her celeſtial diſcourſe, raviſht out of my ſelf, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained not in me any part of life, but onely Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, which attentively waited if it might be able to draw any thing of benefit from that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion. But ſhe nevertheleſſe having done ſpeaking, and making as if ſhe would be gone, if immediatly I did not obey her, I retired moſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſolate out of the Temple, and being returned to my houſe, I ſhut my ſelf into my Cloſet, and there reaſoned to my ſelf.</p>
            <p>Miſerable <hi>Arnaldo!</hi> What hope can be able ſtill to flatter thy diſconſolate heart to miſlead thy tormented ſpirit? Perceiveſt thou not, O wretch, that thy unbridled deſire having led thee too high, menaceth thee with ſome miſerable precipice? And canſt thou with open eyes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold this ruin, without procuring to thy ſelf at leaſt that aſsiſtance which reaſon offers thee, of freeing thy ſelf from the ſnares of this perfidious Love, which onely to render thee unhappy is come to diſturb thy peace with his importunate furies? Alas! Alas, too vain are my thoughts, and too raſh my purpoſes. It's impoſsible that I can ever heal this amorous infirmity, if beauty it
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:170451:20"/>ſelf, which bred it in my breaſt do not cure it, But not daring to hope that; what remains but that I miſerably periſh? My diſconſolate ſpirit! wherefore ſtayeſt thou any longer in this thy miſerable abode, now that it is become a ruth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe Hell of uncomfortable afflictions? Unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate <hi>Arnaldo!</hi> When thou beginneſt to want ſtrength, thou beginſt to augment thy torments; and inſtead of ſeeking a Salve to thy evils by the conſtancy of a generous Cavalier, thou loſeſt thy ſelf in the weakneſſe of vulgar Lovers! And how long haſt thou ſerved <hi>Lucinda,</hi> that ſhe ought to give thee her Love? With the price then of a few moneths of ſervitude wouldeſt thou go about to purchaſe the reward of her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour? The gifts of Love are not obtained with ſo little labour. And again: Ladies deſire to try the fidelity of their ſervants with ſlighting them: but after the Tempeſt of contempts, follows the ſerenity of favours, which they concede to their faithfull Lovers. Love therefore thy <hi>Lucinda;</hi> and ſince thy paſsions are not of a kind that do offend the Laws of the World or of Heaven, hope that the World and Heaven ought to aſsiſt thee in purſuing the end of thy ſervid and honeſt Love.</p>
            <p>Thus, agitated betwixt divers purpoſes, and lacerated by various skirmiſhes of different af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, I knew not to which part, either of hope, or of deſperation, to betake my ſelf: but like a ſhip in the main Ocean toſt by the winds, and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="23" facs="tcp:170451:20"/>obſcured by the Clouds of ſundry perturbati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, all light of the knowledge of my unhappy ſtate, and bereft my ſelf of all the directions of reaſon to arrive to the Port of Conſolations, by the unſafe complacency I took in my Enemie's beauty.</p>

            <p>FOr as much as the <hi>King</hi> ſaw me not to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear any more in Court, and underſtanding in part my new affliction; thinking perhaps to pleaſe me, he elected me maintainer of a Juſting which he had proclaimed for the approaching feaſt of the Spring. And though I was at that time more diſpoſed to retiredneſſe then to the company of Gallants; yet becauſe I would not diſpleaſe the King, I accepted of it. Thereupon, my Soul flattered with I know not what gale of alacrity, I not onely prepared my ſelf to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned enterpriſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but communicated my reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions to a certain number of youthful Knights, and we agreed upon a moſt capricious Mask to preſent at the feaſt which, the night following the Turnament ſhould be celebrated in the Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Hall. But for as much as the deſire of glory did not eaſe my heart ſo much of the weight of its afflictions, that they did not ſtill preſſe me down to the center of melancholly; being got up with the Aurora of that fatal day; I would have
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:170451:21"/>the ſadneſſe of my habit accompany into the field the ſorrow of my mind. So mounted on a <hi>Thracian</hi> Courſer, I appeared in a military po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture, armed with black Arms, with a Caſſock of black Velvet imbroidered with ſtuds of Pearl: an embleme of my tears. The creft of my Helm was dignified with no other enſign, than a mournfull Plume of ſable feathers. But in my ſhield I had cauſed to be depainted a Limbeck from which did drop-in divers parts of the diſtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led water with this Motto: <hi>And within burneth.</hi> Now whilſt the elected Knights prepared to the courſe, I vaulted upon my Horſe before the Scaffold of the Queen, and raiſing my eyes by chance, I ſaw my fair <hi>Lucinda,</hi> which upon an adjoyning Scaffold wrapt in her mournfull Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle (in thoſe Countreys they wear the mourning for their Parents a compleat year) darted through thoſe Clouds the luminous rayes of her Divine face, and menaced with death, who ever through too much boldneſſe ſhould have attempted to fix their looks, on the immortal Sun of that glit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering beauty. What befell me upon ſo unexpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted and aſtoniſhing a ſight, if ever you have been a Lover, you are able to judge. I think I ſhould never have remembred the affair that had called me into that place (I was ſo beſides my ſelf), if <hi>Lucinda</hi> taking notice of my ſtupefaction, with a ſudden fiction of talking with another Lady of her acquaintance, had not, in depriving me of the ſerenity of her face, made me to forſee the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt, which began to riſe in my heart, which, calmed in part by the conſideration of my duty in ſo great an occurrence, I in the end gave be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:170451:21"/>to the Tilting; of which as the incoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and accidents were various, ſo it would be neceſſary I ſhould expatiate in a ſuperfluous diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe if I ſhould recount them all: It ſhall ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice to tell you, that my ſucceſſe in that adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture was ſuch, as I was not able to deſire more with my vows to Fortune for the increaſement of my glory: if love of glory had been able at that time to open a way in that breaſt which knew no other affect then the love of <hi>Lucinda.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Turnament being concluded with the day, and accompanied with the applauſe of all people to my houſe, I diſarmed, and masked my ſelf with the reſt of the Knights my compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; and came into the Hall appointed for the Ball, where, in the preſence of the King, the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces were begun. My conſorts each of them ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving took out his Lady to dance, I withdrew my ſelf apart, more then ever troubled with my fears, and diſtracted by my griefs to ſee my ſelf poor in that good of which I had ſo much need, and rich in that evil which I did ſo much abhor. Yet fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, (thruſt forward by that deſire, which, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindling in my Soul, did ſet me all on fire) I drew near alſo with trembling feet to my fair <hi>Lucinda</hi> to invite her to dance, with almoſt a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain credence of being refuſed. And truely the ſuſpenſion of that Lady confirm'd my belief: But yet in the end conſtrained by generoſity, and by the accuſtomed frequency of ſuch paſſages, ſhe courteouſly gave me her hand. But what paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions did not torment my wretched heart, ſeeing my felicity ſo nigh me, and the remedy of my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>felicity ſo remote? The dance being ended,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:170451:22"/>which made me with its turns to experiment in my Soul, the turning of <hi>Ixions</hi> wheel to torment me; <hi>Lucinda,</hi> (perhaps annoyed with my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence), ſate her ſelf down ſo near the Queen, that it was impoſsible for me to ſpeak a word to her: wherefore withdrawing (almoſt in deſpera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) into a Ward-robe of the <hi>Kings,</hi> I aſſum'd a reſolution to try my Fortune again by writing.

                  <p>LUcinda, <hi>If I was granted as well the means to redreſſing my misfortunes, as I have occaſion of expreſſing them; I am certain I ſhould be more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented, than now I find my ſelf agrieved: But ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing you have bereft from my heart all feeling of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation, though not from my mind all ſenſe of good judgement; have patience alſo, I beſeech you, if I write to you that which doth not pleaſe you. But what can I write, ſince I have written and ſaid ſo much already of my paſſions and miſeries? Let it ſuffice you to know, that except you be in the end moved with commiſeration of my paſſion and ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, you ſhall in a ſhort time ſee the date of my life terminated in my death. And yet, alas, you might with more eaſe, if you ſo pleaſed, collect the infinity of my ſufferings, from my words and from my tears, which abound in my eyes, the ſpeaking mirrours of inamoured and languiſhing minds. I am truely miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, ſince the more conſtant my fidelity is, the more remiſſe you are in vouchſafing it a recompence. And whereas you think, that by giving peace to my life
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:170451:22"/>you muſt proclaim War againſt your virtue; I will not deſire you to do any thing, nor will I ſpeak any thing that may offend you. It ſhall content me, if you but onely vouchſafe ſometimes to caſt your eye on my torments, ſo that the ſweetneſſe of your looks may al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay the ſharpneſſe of my ſorrow: for by this ſlight fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour you may eaſily obtain pardon for the many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries you have ſo often done me. For this onely, be not I beſeech you ſo mortal an Enemy; for if you deſire I ſhould dye, I alſo will not much deſire to live; and ſo we may with little labour both receive ſatisfaction: where as on the other ſide denying me this, the memory of your cruelty and my death would be eternalliz'd. I verily believe, that if you would but follow for a little the impulſe of reaſon, you ſhould ſee how that it's an act unworthy of a noble, and courteous Lady, to torment thoſe that offend you not; unleſſe you can call offence my conſtancy in loving you, and the reſolution I have taken of alwayes ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving you. But if you continue in the ſame opinion which you have formerly expreſt, remember a little, remember,</hi> Lucinda, <hi>the ſufferings that I undergo: I am confident that if my torments were but conſidered by you according to what they are; you would ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther repent them, then perpetuallize them with ſo much ſeverity. And really it's a ſtrange thing and almoſt incredible, that you had rather be cruel to thoſe that love you, than be ſerved by thoſe that adore you. For, did you but condeſcend to conſider the ſorrow you return me in recompence of the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices I tender to you, I aſſure my ſelf, that you would plainly ſee how in glorious it is to inſult in my ruin. I conclude this my paſſionate diſcourſe, words being ſuperfluous after that my preſence hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented

            <p>THis Letter being written and ſeal'd, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned into the Hall, where coming in a certain throng near to <hi>Lucinda,</hi> I put it in the ſlieve of her upper Garment; and withdrew to obſerve how ſhe would entertain it. But for a long time that I had watcht her, I could obſerve nothing: Whereupon I flattered my ſelf with the hope of ſome proſperous ſucceſſe to my at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt. I was therefore ſo diſtracted with this perplexity of thoughts, that I either anſwered nothing, or elſe beſides the purpoſe to thoſe who entertained me with ſome diſcourſe of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Occurrences, either of the Ball, or Court. And he that in that inſtant had toucht my breaſt, might eaſily have felt the palpitations of my heart cauſed by deſire, and perplexing fear, the daughters of a deſperate Love.</p>
            <p>The time being come at laſt, that (the Ball be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ended) every one retired to their own houſe, obſerving that <hi>Lucinda</hi> would take leave of the Queen, I waited on her, diſguiſed in an unknown Garb, not onely home to her houſe, but into her Chamber, without being able to obſerve any thing in her that contributed ſo much as an
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:170451:23"/>atome to my hope. Hence being little inclined to reſt for that night, I diſpatcht <hi>Diffilus</hi> thither at the ſame time, to bring me back ſome news of the fortune of that Paper, which I had adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured in the ſlieve of <hi>Lucinda:</hi> but he could hear nothing good or bad. Whereupon my natural vigour diminiſhing by this fixt application, and my grief encreaſing, continually ſcalding my heart in the inextinguiſhable flames of ſighs, I became wholly melancholy and ſolitary, never deſiring to ſee the face of the Sun more, out of my Chamber.</p>
            <p>Hereupon <hi>Beliſa</hi> my ſiſter, moved to compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of my miſery, as one who felt a great part of it her ſelf; ſitting down cloſe by me one day, ſhe weeping ſaid. <q>Ah! my dear brother, I, intreat thee to acquaint me with the fatal cauſe of this grief, which ſo much afflicts thee. Seeſt thou not that thy affliction is my torment; and that the love I bear thee, makes me to live for thy ſorrow a moſt unhappy life? Thou haſt many times confeſt thy ſelf to be my debter, and that thou wouldeſt recompence my love with a reciprocal affection; But you deny me that with your actions, which you confirm to me with your words. You know very well, that ſuch like diſsimulation ought not to have place near me: make therefore my breaſt the depoſitory of thy paſsions. And to whom wilt thou commit them, if thou wilt not intruſt them to me? Do but think that if thou deſireſt death, I will not wiſh for life; If thou hateſt pleaſure, I will love ſorrow; If thou delighteſt in trouble, I will be diſpleaſed with repoſe: ſo
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:170451:24"/>that thy malady and my torment are one and the ſame thing to excruciate my heart. If there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you deſire to ventilate your paſsion, with whom better can you do it then with me, that am never ſparing in wiſhing your good? I am ſure that diſcharging one part of it upon me, we ſhall together be the better able to bear it. For if thou haſt a deſire to weep, I will weep: if you will comfort your ſelf in your grief, I will ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedite my conſolation: and if you deſire to conceal and nouriſh it, we two can be better able then thou alone to hide and feed it. Shew not, I pray thee, ſo little confidence in her which hath nothing in all the world that is not thine; and make it believed in the end, that thy diſsimulation cannot falſify my judgement; whileſt thy tears and thy ſighs, thy ſadneſſe, and thy ſolitude accuſe me, and too plainly diſcover, that which you ſeek with ſuch care to hide and conceal. It's certain, death ought to be leſſe powerfull then brotherly love; and that therefore death it ſelf ſhall be moſt welcom to me, when by it thou ſhalt come to acquire a joyfull life, ſince that I ſee thee arrived to that paſſe, that thou canſt not long continue alive. But I had rather you would aſſume the ſpirits of your generoſity, and cheer up your ſelf, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering that fortune is alwayes an Enemy of the happy, and favourable to the afflicted: and therefore ſhe being by nature fickle and incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, whereas it befits the fortunate to fear, I would have thee accuſtom thy ſelf to hope in her viciſsitude. She ever cauſeth new actions for the tryal of our minds, becauſe her puiſſance
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:170451:24"/>is better known by the proſperous, then by the calamitous. Reſerve not therefore thy anxious ſolitude to thy ſelf alone: for, if greater is the evil that's hid, than the evil that is manifeſt, thy communicating of it to me may afford thee ſome ſuccour. I intreat thee, dear brother, I intreat thee, let the Key of my counſel open for thee the Door of thy comfort and health; the peril that's concealed being alwayes greater in every occurrence, then that which is diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered. Speak to me therefore, if you love me, and love that we ſhould live together, whether it be dolefully or cheerfully.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Here <hi>Beliſa</hi> ſighing, held her peace: I reply'd. <q>Thou haſt ſo afflicted me (dear ſiſter) with thy paſſion, that in ſome meaſure to comfort thee, I muſt be forced to tell thee what I am unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to diſcloſe. I pray you, before I reveal my condition to you any farther, not to trouble your ſelf with any ſuperfluous care, becauſe I ſhall ſee an end of my dayes, before you ſhall ſee a beginning of the remedy to my dyſaſters. Know therefore (ſiſter) that, more by impulſe of ſtrange Fortune, then by any act of my own will, I was compelled to ſtoop to the Laws of Love, by which Fortune hath deſired to make me acquire ſo much with the merit of my ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, that to my torment I have felt the ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of her I ſerved. My misfortunes have already taken ſo deep impreſſion in my heart, that Fortune in vain forceth her ſelf with her ſlow revolutions to bring any Medicine of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort: ſo that if death in the end do not ſuccour me, relief will come too late from other parts.
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:170451:25"/>I will not then deſpair of life, even in a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual death; and therefore I pray thee, dear ſiſter, rather to comfort then afflict thy ſelf, that thou haſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> a brother, which knows how, and is able to undergo (conquering himſelf) ſo many troubles. For if yet you deſire I ſhould be comforted, and you would do me a good office; let me never ſee thy face ſo delug'd in tears: for if tears could mitigate my paſſion, mine alone would be ſufficient; whereas thine do but increaſe my torments inſtead of contributing relief. In brief, I was born to languiſh, thou to rejoyce: and therefore attend to thy Jollities, which better ſute to the feebleneſſe of thy Sex and to the tenderneſſe of thy years; and leave this ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row to me, as more correſponding to virile for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, and to the proof of my conſtancy. For if you will deport your ſelf otherwiſe, I ſhall believe that you love me but little whileſt you perſiſt to afflict me with your ſadneſſe, redou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling the grief which is of it ſelf but too heavy to be ſupported. Comfort thy ſelf yet, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort thy ſelf <hi>Beliſa,</hi> for thy conſolation will be a great part of my redreſſe, when I ſhall receive thy joy as a ſign of the love thou beareſt to me.</q>

            <p>
               <hi>Beliſa,</hi> ſeeing ſhe could not get any thing out of me of what ſhe deſired, determined to let me alone, and inform her ſelf better by other means. But, I having already imparted this my miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adventure (without acquainting him with the occaſion) to a Knight my friend; (not ſo much becauſe I held any great confidence in his fideli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, as becauſe of the vicinity of his houſe to that
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:170451:25"/>of my fair Enemy: conſidering that from every part my pains increaſed, I reſolved to vent my paſſion to him afreſh, fancying the encounter at leaſt of ſome occaſion of comforting my ſelf ſometimes in the ſight of her, who though I did not ſee, yet had ſtuck ſo many darts of grief in my breaſt. I cauſed him to be ſent for to my Chamber, and ſeeing him ſo compaſsionate of my adverſities, as that he made a ſhew he would ſubvert the world to relieve me; I, as one who eaſily believed what I deſired, ſaid unto him.</p>
            <q>
               <p>Friend <hi>Jerſus,</hi> If I go about now to diſcover to thee that, which I have ſo long concealed, of my afflictions; yet believe that I am conſtrained to it by the high confidence I hold of thy loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty, and the love thou beareſt me. Beſides, if hitherto it hath been a vertue to bury my griefs in ſilence, at the preſent it is a vice; ſince, after ſo long a ſiege of torments, I muſt yield to the aſſaults of Love and Death. And from what may I better requeſt ſuccour in ſuch anguiſh to the diſtraction of my tormented heart, than from thy fidelity, and from thy courteſie, whilſt that death purſues me, and that life rather of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fends then helps me? This cruel aſſault began (dear friend) from that day on which the father of <hi>Lucinda</hi> died, for then died in me all light of content; never knowing what truce or peace was to an anxious mind. For, Love ſeeing me ſo free, and diſengaged from his Laws, that I derided his power, reſolved to aſſault me with all the force of his Empire; and though vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and great was my defence, he had fought with ſuch ſharpneſſe and aſsiduity, that I was
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:170451:26"/>deprived of all ſuccour of reaſon, or of deſpera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and I ſaw my ſelf come to that paſſe that I was forced to render my ſelf to the diſcretion of his tyrannical indiſcretion. And if thou thinkeſt (dear <hi>Jerſus</hi>) that I talking thus, am out of my right ſenſes, believe me, friend, it would be the greateſt of my felicities to be deprived of judgement; as the greateſt of my infelicities comes from the knowledge of, and inability to redreſſe, my dyſaſters: Whereas if I were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of underſtanding, as I could hope no good, ſo I would fear no evil; but being free from the tumults of paſſion, and the Wars of the ſenſes, I would live full of inward tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity. Behold me therefore reduced to ſo miſerable a ſtate, that I know not whither to have recourſe for ſuccour in theſe laſt minutes of my life, unleſſe to the candour of our friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, which, with the Arms of thy counſels, and thy courteſie, are able to raiſe from about my Soul the tedious Leaguer of my living death, and dying hopes; The adjacency of thy houſe to that of my fair and inflexible Enemy, may at leaſtwiſe ſtand me in ſo much ſtead, as to open to me a door of eſcape, either by means of hope or deſpair. The reality of thy Amity (which in neceſſity is beſt-experimented and known) may be able with the prudence of thy advice and indeavours, wholly to ſet me free: for I know very well that thou haſt more deſire to gratifie me herein, then I have to entreat thee to it.</p>
               <p>Having thus ſaid, I held my peace, and <hi>Jerſus</hi> promptly replied; Friend <hi>Arnaldo,</hi> I might
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:170451:26"/>juſtly be offended at the diffidence, which thou ſheweſt to have ſo long had of my Loyalty, concealing thy troubles from me, and revealing them juſt now, when by the Laws of Love thou waſt bound to ſuppreſſe them. What haſt thou got by thy ſilence, which hath deprived thee of the benefit thou mighteſt have acquired, and drawn upon thee that miſchief thou didſt not merit? I ſhall nevertheleſſe forbear to ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravate thy grief with ſuperfluous loquaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, being my ſelf but too much troubled for thy afflictions, which the ſenſe of Pity and the bond of Amity hath made common to me. Thou ſayeſt, The beauty of <hi>Lucinda</hi> deſtroyes thy life, and ſhe it is doth alſo ruin my health; for as much then, as I know no difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween my will and thine: ſince that thou re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireſt my counſel in ſuch an exigent, aſſure thy ſelf that if my advice might but as much avail thee, as thy malady torments me; thou wouldeſt immediatly be free, from all ſenſe of either perplexity, or pain. Yet to tell thee my thoughts plainly, it doth aſtoniſh and grieve me to think, that thou ſhouldeſt voluntarily conſent, that the greatneſſe of thy courage ſhould be foild and overcome by a thing ſo weak and contemptible; and that thou which wert wont to bear the victory from the braveſt Cavaliers in the world, ſhould'ſt be overcome by a Feminine feebleneſſe. And for the further increaſe of my diſguſts, I ſee that thy Soul is that which falſifieth thy faith, and tenders thee in a manner a rebel to reaſon: for thou makeſt thy ſelf the miniſter to thy own ſervitude and
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:170451:27"/>calamity. Fly therefore ſuch extreams of Love, which tranſport thee to an extream un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthineſſe: not that I would have thee ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh it wholly from thy knowledge (there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no leſſe peril in too much ſolicitude to avoid it, then in too much aſſiduity to purſue it) but that thou eſteem it, fear it, ſeek it, and contemne it with a generoſity and liberty worthy of thy noble bloud, and of thy great Soul. For if Love be of it ſelf a deceitfull af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, do thou alſo deceive him; his Laws being ſuch, that he, who loveth leaſt, obtaineth the greateſt recompence; and who ſerveth moſt, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth the greateſt ingratitude. In ſum, I conſent that thou ſhalt follow Love, but not make thy ſelf his Slave; and that thou deſpiſe him not, but much leſſe that thou truſt him at any hand. <hi>Conſider that hope in eaſie things deceiveth, in difficult betrayeth;</hi> and that For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune gives an unexpected iſſue to all humane affairs: and therefore ſeeing it's the cauſe of thy ſorrow, do thou alſo deceive it in making it the means of thy joy. For I aſſure thee, if thou wouldeſt follow my counſel (now that I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt thee) thou ſhalt eaſily by this means ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that, which thou ſhalt certainly loſe by going to my houſe; in which nevertheleſſe thou art abſolute maſter, when, and how thou plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt. And certainly thou haſt done thy ſelf great wrong to delay ſo long to contribute to thy comfort: knowing that thou art more lord of my will, then I am of my own houſe: and for that cauſe I am obliged to ſerve thee in all oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currences wherein I may be uſefull. I ſhall
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:170451:27"/>ſay no more, for words are fruitleſſe, where my thought is onely of comforting thee, and not to perplex thee with talk. And therefore now, if you ſo pleaſe, let us go to make a tryal of my Wit, and of thy Fortune.</p>
            </q>
            <p>Thus ſaid <hi>Jerſus,</hi> but whileſt I hear'd him talk ſo ſiniſterly of <hi>Lucinda,</hi> I felt my heart e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually to boil with diſdain, and my mind to freeze with ſuſpition and jealouſie: Yet with diſſembling ſpeeches he ſought to make me be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that ſuperfluity of Love would make me rave in my thoughts. So I partly diſtruſted him, &amp; partly aſſured my ſelf that in regard of our an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient friendſhip he would obſerve that which he promiſed. Seeing therefore that he had ſo freely offered me his houſe, I reſolved to go live there for ſome dayes: but I ſoon found my ſelf fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated in my hopes, for with all the diligence I could poſſibly uſe, I could not in all the time I ſtayed there, come ſo much as once to the ſight of her, for whoſe ſake I had removed unto that Lodging. Hereupon <hi>Beliſa,</hi> afflicted in my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent peril, by the conſideration of my future pain, at laſt inveſtigating the cauſe of my mala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, ſhe changed her courſe of life, and without making me in the leaſt privy to her deſign, began to frequent the houſe of <hi>Lucinda,</hi> with whom ſhe had before upon ſome other account contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted friendſhip; ſo that one day ſhe being ente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red into diſcourſe with her, finding her in a good humour, ſhe thus ſpake to her.</p>
            <q>
               <p>I intreat thee, my friend, that uſing thy pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence thou will not blame me for that, which I am about to tell thee, preſuming rather to me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:170451:28"/>applauſe then reprehenſion; whil'ſt my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion of another's miſery excuſeth my ſhame. Dear <hi>Lucinda,</hi> my deplorable brother <hi>Arnaldo,</hi> for his great affection to thee dayly increaſeth his affliction, impaireth his health, impoiſoning even thoſe remedies which ſhould reſtore him to it. Not that I have the leaſt intimation from him of his Love, having alwayes denied the true cauſe of his torments: but yet I have been ſo ſollicitous to ſift out the truth, that I have come to know, that thou onely art the cauſe of his miſery, and mayeſt become the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorer of his life. I have for this reaſon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to ſtrain modeſty, to provide (if I can poſſible) for his ſafety and my ſorrow. And I profeſſe, that if I did not ſee his life in danger, thou ſhouldeſt not have known the leaſt hint of my trouble. Moved therefore by a compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionate zeal for his conſervation, and to redreſſe my own calamity, (becauſe wanting him, who in the quality of an onely brother ſupplieth the place of my deceaſed Parents, I ſhould be left ſolitary and diſconſolate): I come to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat thee, that thou wouldeſt not at once with his life, annihilate my conſolation, &amp; decollate our family; acquiring to thy ſelf inſtead of a perpetual glory, an eternal infamy for thy cruelty and his death: for certain I am, he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not, ſo ill treated as he is, prolong his life be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the date of a few moneths. O conſider, I beſeech thee, conſider, how much thou art oblig'd to him, whil'ſt the more thou ſlighteſt him, the more he loves thee: and onely deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth death, becauſe thou art diſpleaſed with his
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:170451:28"/>life. Herein, while he for love of thee joyes in his torments, and none know that thou art ſhe which ſo much afflicteſt him, thou art doubly ingaged to him; and therefore at laſt relent into commiſeration of his ſo great indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and permit not his fidelity to periſh by thy ingratiude. What though thou art not pleaſed to receive him to the honour of thy converſation, wilt not thou therefore gratify him at leaſt with an anſwer to his Letter? And if yet thou wilt not do it, by inſtinct of a grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full mind towards him, yet do it, dear <hi>Luc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>nda,</hi> for courteſie towards me: who, in ſo doing, of a faithfull friend that I am, thou ſhalt oblige me to become thy perpetuall ſlave. Let it content thee that it's now two years, that I have languiſhed under theſe ſufferings, and reſtore me, ſince thou maiſt do it without trouble.</p>
            </q>
            <p>
               <hi>Lucinda</hi> preſently replyed: My dear friend <q>and companion; Thou haſt no ground to fear that thou haſt in any kind prejudiced thy Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty, whilſt the pitty of a Brother and the confidence of a Friend abſolves thee of all ſuſpition, and frees thee from all aſperſion. For though thou haſt in part offended me with thy propoſitions, thou haſt alſo ſatisfyed me with thy honeſt innocence: there being more cauſe thou ſhouldeſt grieve at thy brother's miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes, than for any fault thou mighteſt commit againſt my perſon. It exceedingly grieves me that I cannot give thee the ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction which thou deſireſt, for although the miſery of thy brother afflicts me, yet I cannot
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:170451:29"/>apply my ſelf to give him a remedy; that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a thing would reflect upon my reputation, to which I ought to have greater regard than to his health. And thou art not ignorant, how much the honour of a woman is diminiſhed, when to ſuccour Lovers they forget them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. Requeſt me not therefore to do that, which thou canſt not do thy ſelf: and I would it had pleaſed God, that thou didſt not deſire of me a thing impoſſible for my power to effect, and thou ſhouldeſt ſoon ſee how much I love thee by my removing thy trouble. Heaven knows how oft it hath grieved me, that this my beauty hath been the occaſion of ſo much miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief to <hi>Arnaldo:</hi> How oft I have condol'd his tears when I conſidered, he importuned me to a thing I could not grant. Believe me, friend; that I have a greater deſire to acquit him of his maladyes, then thou haſt to requeſt me. And if by any other means, than that of my ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, I might give him eaſe; believe me, I would more freely offer it, than he ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire it. But becauſe his acquiſt cannot be, but with my loſs; he ought to content himſelf with the goodwill I conſerve towards him (of which I deſire thee to give him aſſurance,) as alſo the grief I ſuffer for the pain he indureth. Do thou alſo excuſe me, beloved <hi>Beliſa,</hi> if I concede not to all that thou wiſheſt; becauſe I am not permitted, with a <hi>Salvo</hi> to my honour, to grant thee any advantage; and reſt ſecure that in all other occurrences, thou ſhalt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes find me moſt ready at thy beck.</q>
            </p>
            <p>After ſome other ſuch like paſſages, <hi>Beliſa</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:170451:29"/>to me, and to comfort me ſaid, that ſhe came from viſiting <hi>Lucinda:</hi> but hiding from me her fatal anſwer, ſhe wiſely endeavoured to make me hope that which ſhe had been deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. But perfectly perceiving by her ſilence, how ill ſhe had ſucceeded in her attempt, it came in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to my mind to penetrate yet farther into the breſt of <hi>Lucinda.</hi> I fain'd therefore that I had no deſire to think more of her life, ſince ſhe ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red ſo little for my duty; and prayed <hi>Beliſa,</hi> that the next time ſhe ſaw her, ſhe would give her to underſtand this my reſolution, of ſeeking for the time to come to learn to be my ſelf, that I might not do ſo much to my prejudice in the love of a perſon, that was to me ſo ingratefull. And <hi>Beliſa</hi> having promiſed to content me, I proceeded to inſtruct her, punctually to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve that Lady's countenance and behaviour upon the reception of my meſſage; becauſe I could better from this then from her words, be able to comprehend the truth of her intentions: And above all, that ſhe ſhould note well the change of colours in her face; for by them com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly the affects of the mind, and impreſſions of the heart do manifeſt themſelves. From the manner alſo of her ſpeech, either deliberate, or haſty, I would have been able to draw ſome ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations of her thoughts; (for from ſpeaking with leiſure or liberty, with anxiety or celeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, much may be collected of another's purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes;) which may but ill be diſſembled by the external appearance. <hi>Beliſa</hi> writ theſe adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſements in her memory, againſt ſhe ſhould ſee a convenient occaſion to meet with <hi>Lucinda;</hi>
               <pb n="42" facs="tcp:170451:30"/>and finding her on a time alone, ſhe beſpoke her in this manner.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lucinda,</hi> if my propoſitions ſhall aſmuch <q>offend thee, as they make me bluſh, impute to the inconſtancy of humane deſires this my im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity, occaſioned for thy ſervice, rather then the relief of my brother: who, in ſhort, ſeeing that he reaped no profit of his ſervices, and that they encreaſed thy contempt of him, hath reſolved to put himſelf upon an impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble enterprize, which is, to ceaſe farther to incommode thee with his amorous Paſſions: yet, impoſſible as it is, he will attempt it, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king his abſence a medicine for thy homicide, and his death; for he hopes to obtain that by this voluntary exile, which thy preſence per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits him not to find. But, if even thou alſo ſhalt conſent to this reſolution, I aſſure thee, friend, that I ſhall procure my death rather then ſurvive this misfortune. And thus I ſhall come to be betrayed by you both, whom I ſo much love, like mortal enemies; dying not for having offended you, but for having too much affected you. Can it be poſſible, dear <hi>Lucinda,</hi> that thou wilt be ſo cruel to ſuch a fidelity as my brother profeſſeth to thee, and ſo ingrateful to ſuch an Amity as I bear to thee? And how canſt thou ever poſſeſs her Will entire, whoſe Life thou rendeſt in pieces? How canſt thou nouriſh a legitimate correſpondence of friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip with her, thou ſo inhumanely transfixeſt? Oh reform at length with new Laws ſuch thy implacable obdurateneſs, which thou falſely calleſt zeal of honour, when as that Ladie doth
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:170451:30"/>not in the leaſt offend her virtue, who corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondeth to the legitimate Affection of a Knight, which loves, and ſerves her according to the ſtabliſhed Laws of Heaven, and Nature. I hope I pretend not to have thee decline the leaſt punctilio of thy virtue; but I verily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that if thou wouldeſt grant me what I ask, thou mighteſt glory in having, with a ſmall benevolence, reſtored to life, two per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons otherwiſe dead. There is nothing doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs loſt of thy reputation, whilſt thou doſt but prevent the perdition of a Knight that adores thee, and ſalve the miſery of a Dame that loves thee. Make them therefore but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to underſtand in two words, that thou art not pleaſed with his departure, and that thou art diſpleaſed with her diſpair. It is but a ſmall matter I beg, the writing of two lines of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement, for the reprieve of two lives, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out prejudicing thy ſelf.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Here <hi>Beliſa</hi> concluded her diſcourſe by the commencing of her tears, giving <hi>Lucinda</hi> time to reply in this manner. <q>I intreate thee to ceaſe theſe tears, and ſweeten the bitterneſs of thy grief; for I ſhall do all I can for thy ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction and comfort. But I would to God I were for the preſent without a tongue, that I might not ſpeak for love of thee a thing ſo op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite to reaſon. Thou oughteſt not to glory in the power that thou haſt over my heart; for if in this particular I ſhall commit any errour, thou onely art to be blam'd; having with thy loving importunity forced me to do what I would not. I ſuſpend therefore my reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:170451:31"/>that I may content thee, deſiring thee onely to accept my good will, and not to ſlight my gifts after thou haſt once received them: it being an ordinary cuſtom of men, highly to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem things difficult to attain, and deſpiſe them when gotten. I will write to <hi>Arnaldo,</hi> but look to it, that he hereafter adventures not to deſire any thing farther of me; for I aſſure thee, that by ſeeking to make greater acquiſts, he will loſe what he hath acquired. For I confeſſe unto thee, that I repent already of my promiſe, which yet, ſince it pleaſeth thee, I cannot retract. Write I will, but I had rather the earth had opened to ſwallow me, than it ſhould have entered into my mind, in this to have gratified thee.</q> This ſaid, <hi>Lucinda</hi> took her pen, and with great diſcompoſure of mind, writ to mee in theſe words.</p>

                  <p>I <hi>Believe,</hi> Arnaldo, <hi>that my letter will find you more merry then it hath left me ſad: But thou wouldeſt not have an occaſion to complain of me, if now when I moved this hand to write, it had been dryed up, rather then render its liberty at another's perſwaſion to give thee, not being in the leaſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debted to thee, too pretious a pledge. Yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, I would not have thee preſume, upon my preſent writing to thee, that it is becauſe thou haſt been offended at my paſt ſilence. Receive this my let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter therefore with moderate reſentments: wiſely diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling thy joy at this thy good fortune; as thou haſt done the vehemence of thy Love. And above
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:170451:31"/>all, remember</hi> Arnaldo <hi>that when men go about to publiſh ſuch like Victories over women, they make a ſacrifice of their honours, expoſing them to the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumnies of contumelious tongues. For if thou knoweſt what thou ſtandeſt in need of, thou ſhouldeſt alſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, what is fit for me to do; having alwayes in thy eye, that to comply with thee, I am become of a Lady a Slave, or rather an enemy to my ſelf; for when thou ſhalt ſing of thy glory, I ſhall be condoling of my faults. O how many times have I took my hand off from this paper with a reſolution not to write to thee! But alaſſe! what ſhould ſhe do, that cannot defend her ſelf from thy importunities? Go to, reſt at laſt from thy troubles, take a reſolution of thy doubts, and glory in that thou haſt no more occaſion of contraſt. I have underſtood by thy ſiſter, that thou wilt travel into ſome other Country, at which I am greatly diſpleaſed; for who cannot be inſtrumentall to the good of another, ſhould avoid all occaſions of doing them harm. I yet (to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs the truth) have judged that this thy invention, is rather feigned then real: ſo that if thou intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt to deceive me, Loe now thou haſt done it. But I muſt tell thee, that in deceiving me thou haſt co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſened thy ſelf: and that thou ſhalt not be a jot the better for the tricks you Lovers make uſe of, that you may triumph in deceiving the conſtancy of thoſe infortunate maids, that truſt you. Boaſt not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in thy ſubtilty, and believe me not to be ſuch a fool, as I think thee in this particular. In ſhort, I would have thee know, that its more out of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion of thy ſufferings, then for any fear of thy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture, that I am perſwaded to write to thee: or rather for pitty of thy Siſter, whoſe ſorrows, as evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:170451:32"/>of the torments ſhe ſuffers for thy ſake, I have been no longer able to indure. Of all this I thought good to advertiſe thee by this my letter, with which I deſire you to reſt content, without pretending to any further advantage: otherwiſe thou mayſt chance to loſe that, which for the merits of thy Siſter thou haſt acquired. Comfort thy ſelf therefore within thy ſelf, and ſuffer me in peace; for although thy departure would diſpleaſe me, I intend not never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe that thy ſtay ſhall turn to my prejudice: and eſpecially have a care it enter not into thy thoughts to deſire to ſee, or ſpeak with me, that ſo thy importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity impoſe not upon me a neceſſity of diſpleaſing thee afreſh by my denyals. Uſe thy diſcretion and live happily.</hi>

            <p>THis letter being writ and delivered to my ſiſter, <hi>Lucinda</hi> withdrew, and <hi>Beliſa</hi> run to ſeek me, to give it to me. I received it with the ſame joy, a Miſer would have entertain'd a Treaſure; or the Mortally-ſick-patient, a health<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Medicine; not being able almoſt to ſuffer my ſelf to underſtand this good Fortune. At laſt, I awaking out of my ſtupor, <hi>Beliſa</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted to me the diſcourſes held with this Fair one; the which having underſtood, I ſet my ſelf with a high attention to the reading this let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: but he that ſhould have then ſeen my face ſhining with a new colour of pleaſantneſſe, might thereby have collected how much virtue and vivacity thoſe inanimate characters had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed into my dead ſoul. Yet this my joy was
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:170451:32"/>of no long durance, for I did preſently prove in my ſelf how true it was, that high ſoring flights are near the moſt precipitous falls, I being paſt from a ſupream content, to an extream deſpera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Thus I ſtood a good ſpace, fighting be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween joy and grief, without knowing to which part to betake me; for when I thought to take heart, the little hope I had did not permit me; and if I thought of afflicting my ſelf, the good will I ſeemed to ſee in <hi>Lucinda,</hi> did not ſuffer me. Wanting therefore the counſel of others, I reſolved to anſwer her Letter in theſe words.</p>

                  <head>Arnaldo <hi>to</hi> Lucinda.</head>
                  <p>LUcinda, <hi>your Letter brought in its firſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance an inexplicable pleaſure. But the joy I took in ſeeing it, is vaniſhed in reading it, by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn of a greater confuſion of ſadneſſe. Thus that Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per which [ſealed] promiſed me remedy, [open] con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd me in my miſery: ſo that judging by it of your intention, I ſaw my ruin nearer then my relief. But if,</hi> Lucinda, <hi>you write to me, how that you compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionate my misfortunes, wherefore do you all you can to afflict me? your words correſpond not with your actions; but as crafty as you are, you at the ſame time thruſt me away with your heart, and flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter me with hope; and beſpeak your ſelf reſolved never to put an end to my torments, but with my death. Wherefore uſe you ſuch diſſimulation with him that adores you? Ah!</hi> Lucinda, <hi>I had far ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that you were doubtfull of my ſufferings, then that believing them you ſhould not ſeek to remove them. And what am I the better for your advice,</hi>
                     <pb n="48" facs="tcp:170451:33"/>To uſe your favours moderately, <hi>if you your ſelf cancell and provoke them, in the ſame inſtant you beſtow them? If you were but as willing to cure my maladies, as I have been patient to undergo them, my Paſſion would not have any thing in it wherewith to torment me: I having alwayes veiled my flames with a perpetual ſilence; whereas your favours come ſo difficultly from you, that almoſt as ſoon as they are born they languiſh to my greater prejudice. If therefore it be true that you deſire my ſatisfaction, depoſe your ſeverity: if you would that I ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve you, lay aſide this diſſimulation. Content your ſelf that you have robbed me of the better part of my life, and that I am now running upon my own ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord to death, without deſiring me by theſe fallacious hopes to prolong my life, to endure every minute a centuplicated death. In ſhort, ſince the more my faithfulneſſe ſhews it ſelf, the further I am from my reward, and you have reſolv'd that I die; die I will. And becauſe that in this place, ſeeing my ſelf ſo afflicted by your cruelty, I cannot behold others jollity without a multiplied and Tantalizing torment; I will go die in a place ſo remote from all humane converſation, that the name of</hi> Arnaldo <hi>ſhall never arive to the notice of any man. Yet before I depart, I beg of you this onely favour to ſee you; and becauſe you ſhall not think that I requeſt any thing of you, unbefitting my Honour and your Reputation; I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat you to do it in ſo open a place that malice it ſelf can find no occaſion to cenſure you: and this alſo more for your own ſervice then for my ſatisfaction; that ſo in my diſcoloured complexion you may read the power of your beauty; of which I am a perpetual Idolater: conſecrating my ſelf an eternal Slave of
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:170451:33"/>Love, vowing to reverence and adore you to the laſt minute of my life. Yet I herein deny not the Deities to be adored and ſupplicated. Condeſcend you there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to vouchſafe me a favour, which ſhall redound more to your glory than to my content: Till then I render you moſt humble thanks, for the honour done me with your Letter, and, proſtrate at your feet, I humbly kiſſe your hand.</hi>

            <p>I Return'd this anſwer to the fair <hi>Lucinda,</hi> but never received the leaſt counter-ſign, either of repulſe, or acceptation of my requeſt. I had therefore recourſe anew to the help of <hi>Beliſa,</hi> to the end ſhe might obtain me a favour ſo paſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natly deſired. She went to her, though with ſome bluſhings; and after many words forced her to be content to let me ſee her in a certain place of great reſort, where as if talking with my ſiſter I might meet her, without ſuſpition of any cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondency.</p>
            <p>The day and hour appointed being come, what I ſaid, and did, in that incounter may be more eaſily imagined then expreſt. I am ſure, I felt all the time of that expectation ſo great a content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that my miſery changed into felicity, for ſo much deſired, and ſo little hoped for a victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. In ſum, ſo jocund apprehenſions did at that time rejoyce my mind, that although I had nothing, I did not deſire a more advantagious Fortune. Now judge you, deareſt Stranger, what joy I found, and felt then in ſpeaking to <hi>Lucinda</hi> of my pains, and by ſupplicating her to have pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:170451:34"/>on me, and to give me at laſt ſome honeſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence for my conſtant fidelity. Our diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes though they were not long were many, and we came to this concluſion; That I ſhould not ſtir from thence, and much leſſe that I ſhould let any one know my intereſt in her perſon. Alaſs! I ſee now that this was a plot of her wonted Feminine diſſimulation, that ſhe alwayes deſired ſecreſie in Love; and in vain did I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort my ſelf in it: and yet it was no other then a mark of her unfaithfull mind, that being not yet arrived to the end ſhe deſigned for my ultimate deſtruction; ſhe would not have my departure deprive her of the friendſhip of my ſiſter, whom ſhe uſed, to deceive me; nor that the publication of my pledge, ſhould diſcredit the baſeneſſe of her intentions, whil'ſt ſlighting a perſonage of Regal Extract, ſhe ſet her affections upon a Knight of vulgar Birth and Fortune. Such ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice lodg'd in the heart of a young Lady, To de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive him that lov'd her, to betray him that ador'd her.</p>

            <p>THus ſaying, the Knight ſigh'd from the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of his Soul, and holding his peace ſome ſpace, he continued his diſcourſe in this manner. Deareſt Gueſt! already the Sun hath aſcended half of his Carier above the Horizon; it would
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:170451:34"/>be therefore good counſel, for this time not to weary you with the Narration of my ſiniſter ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventures, but that in the umbrage of theſe meadows we do a little refreſh languiſhing na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Having ſcarce ſo ſaid, he with a little ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-whiſtle gave intimation to his people of what he deſired, and that Forreſt was in a ſhort ſpace peopled by the noble attendants of the Knight. Where, near a Fountain by him made in that part, (it being his own ground) with black mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, ſadned by the repreſentation of tragical oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currences, the Table was prepared. Here <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naldo</hi> having by the mirth of the banquet, and by the pleaſantneſſe of the place given way to ſome ſentiments of delight, began to ask me of the news of the world, and of the principal Courts of the <hi>Grecian</hi> Kingdoms. And the firſt that appeared on the ſcene of our diſcourſe was the Duke of <hi>Sparta,</hi> with whom having had ſome familiarity in the quality of Senators, he admired to hear him riſen by the help of his Enemies to ſuch a Grandure. It is not to be wondred at, ſaid I, becauſe when Heaven will puniſh men for their faults, it is ſo ordered, that the inſtruments of the offence are changed to them into inſtruments of chaſtiſement. The impieties of former Princes have been ſo high, that they mixed the Antidotes with the poyſon of their Crimes. Wo be to the world, ſaid <hi>Arnaldo,</hi> if the like meaſure ſhould ſucceed in all Principalities. And yet (added I) it ſeems the paſſages of theſe ages do authoriſe this verity with a manifeſt proof. Behold <hi>Thrace,</hi> with its King murthered &amp; ſtrangled! Behold <hi>Macedon</hi> without legitimate Heirs, with <hi>Migdonia,</hi> &amp; <hi>Theſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaly</hi>
               <pb n="52" facs="tcp:170451:35"/>revolted from the Crown. Conſider <hi>Ep rus,</hi> turned upſide down with the ambition of thoſe which the intereſts of State, and the obſtinacy of the late King, made to be ingrafted (injuſtly, as being Baſtards) into the ſtem of the bloud Royal. Turn your eies to the Princes of <hi>Illyrium;</hi> who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing exiled, depreſſed, &amp; extinct in the prime flower of their greatneſſes, all that vaſt Province is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolate, and burnt up by the fierceſt flames of War. And, croſsing the Seas, behold <hi>Cyprus</hi> with its Princes exterminated, (a barbariſm unus'd through all ages) even by the hand of the infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Hang-man: and, thence running through all the Provinces of our Climate, ye will find but-too-Authentick to the detriment of many people, this Maxim, <hi>That the inſtruments of evils, are turned by the juſtice of heaven into inſtruments of chaſtiſements to Delinquents.</hi> The Knight ſtood ſome time ſuſpended at this my Diſcourſe; but I, that againſt my will had ſet my thoughts and Diſcourſe upon ſuch à Subject; took occaſion from thence to divert my talk, and commended the goodly fountain (which did ſpout out of the Horn of an <hi>Acteon,</hi> transformed into a Stag) its ſparkling Cryſtals, ſaying: Now that we treat of the miſchiefs, which ſo much at preſent ſcourge our Kingdoms; I know not courteous Sir, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you have ever made reflexion on this other truth, That all the evils of men ordinarily take riſe from women, nor ſo much from the bad as from the good; whence, with reaſon, a noble Wit w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Yea, verily, I have conſidered (anſwered <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naldo</hi>) that almoſt all the evils, which at preſent peſter our Kingdoms, if they be well regarded will be found to take their birth from women. It's a high conſideration, ſaid I, and worthy of the ſublimeneſſe of your Ingenuity. But, with your leave, let us onely obſerve what is repreſented to us, in the gracefull Statue which dignifieth this regal Forreſt: and it is, that the major part of the calamities of men take their birth as did that of <hi>Acteon,</hi> from the curioſity of looking on other mens wives, and from the wickedneſſe withall of thoſe Females, that Metamorphiſe their huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands into <hi>Acteons.</hi> It is very right, ſaid the Knight; <hi>Nor hath the Juſtice of Heaven a heavier ſcourge for mortals then that of Feminine wickednes:</hi> while men in the mean time on the other ſide, by no other way ſo head-ſtrongly rebel againſt Heaven, as by the Love of women. Of which, though from a divers cauſe, I can render you moſt ample teſtimony, ſince that having with ſo much fidelity Idolized my unfaithfull <hi>Lucinda,</hi> in all that time I lived in ſuch a dotage, I never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred either heaven, or my ſelf; and I am now reduced by her means after a thouſand deaths of intolerable dyſaſters, to live a life more painfull then death.</p>
            <p>Thus ſaid the Knight; when, upon the inſtant, hearing a mighty noyſe in the Forreſt, we all ſet
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:170451:36"/>our ſelves to gueſs what might occaſion it. The ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of the Cavalier had already catch't up their Arms for our defence, when we beheld to rouſe on the left ſide of the Fountain a goodly Stag, of an extraordinary bigneſſe, which in a full carier fled the eminent peril, threatned him from the perſecutions of a Huntreſſe. But ſtumbling up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſome Veſſels for the ſervice of the Table, which ſtood in the entrance of that Track, he hapned to fall precipitouſly into a little pit of the Meadow, where the Huntreſſe over-took him, and ſtuck two mortal darts into his flank and head, with ſuch a dexterity that like lightning at the drawing of the Bow they vaniſh'd. Having made the blow, the beautifull Laſſe caſt her eyes on the Table, and congi'd with a gentle ſmile, dying the face of the Knight with a noble bluſh; and began to proceed on her way. But <hi>Arnaldo,</hi> riſing to anſwer her courteous Salute, with great affability intreated her to ſit down, to take with us a ſhort repaſt, after that her victorious chaſe. The Damſel turned about, ſmiling with a grace able to inchant Souls with Love, and ſaid; Some great prodigy is hapned in the world, now that the Enemy of converſation invites Strangers to his Table. But I cannot receive the honour you exhibit to me, being expected by my company on the other ſide the River to Dinner. <hi>Arnaldo</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted her. You will arive too late, it being above three miles off; but if you will pleaſe to favour us with a ſhort ſtay, we will alſo wait up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on you thither. I give you humbly thanks, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied the ſprightly Virago; but that would be too much trouble for you, to paſſe beyond the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fines
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:170451:36"/>which incloſe you in this ſalvage habitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. But it's a good prediction, that ſeeing gueſts now with you in ſtrange garbs, I may think, that you will at laſt put an end to this inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane ſolitude, which deprives the world of the glory of your perſon. This ſaying, with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions equally free and generous, ſhe bore us company at dinner, and out of temperance ſcarce taſted any of the diſhes, taking a little cup of water from the fountain, to ſhew how little our nature is content with, and how the worth of women is inhanced by their abſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence. This done, ſhe took her leave, and would not by any means ſuffer either the Knight or his ſervants to accompany her, onely ſaying, She recommended the prey to him; for being taken in his juriſdiction. The fair Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſe being gone, I was even dead with deſire to know her Quality: for the air of her looks, and the freeneſſe of her deportment, made me plainly perceive, ſhe was more then a meer <hi>Denizon</hi> of the forreſt; but the Knight foreſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my curioſity, which peradventure he read in my eyes, he obligingly ſaid; Behold, moſt dear gueſt, our diſcourſe confirmed with a new proof, that from women, and from good women, are occaſioned all the calamities of men; ſince for ſo courteous, virtuous, and innocent a Maid, many perſons are at this inſtant endangered, and many families ruined.</p>
            <p>This fair young-one was born in the Iſle of <hi>Negroponte,</hi> of a very noble family, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned by kindred to the Royal blood. Being grown to fourteen years of age, her parents dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:170451:37"/>and ſhe remained with three ſiſters more, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the tyrannicall government of her brethren; who having deſigned her againſt her will, and contrary to all reaſon, to a manner of life little pleaſing to her, as being a lover of Liberty, did thereby occaſion to themſelves extream misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes. She was for her ſingular beauty loved and deſired, by the moſt accompliſhed Gallants, and nobleſt Knights of that Court: but ſhe, (yet nevertheleſſe with a ſoul truly generous in ſo young a Ladie) did not ſcornfully deſpiſe, but courteouſly refuſe the ſervice of all the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Cavaliers; declaring her ſelf to like onely the Services of <hi>Calliſthenes,</hi> a young Gallant, noble of blood, and more noble for ingenuity; but of ſo ſlender a Fortune, that he could ſcarce ſuſtain in any ſplendor, the Nobility tranſmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him from his Anceſtors. This application of the Damſel, highly diſpleaſed the Brothers; for having already advantagiouſly marryed the eldeſt ſiſter, they deſigned to bury her, together with theſe younger, according to the uſe of thoſe parts, in the perpetuall ſolitude of a ſecluſe life in the Country, with a title incapable of the marriage-freedoms. Nor did they long defer this their tyrannicall reſolution, having con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined the fair <hi>Argoſthenia</hi> and the other innocent creatures, in a houſe built upon the top of a mountain, in a ſituation almoſt inacceſſible, being incircled on every ſide with forreſts and mountains of their own juriſdiction. Hither <hi>Argoſthenia</hi> being come, inſtead of attending the imployments abhorred by her genius, ſhe began, like a new <hi>Diana</hi> of thoſe woods, with
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:170451:37"/>her bow and boar-ſpear, to diſturb the peace of the wild beaſts, which in great abundance ſhel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred themſelves in that ſolitary and deſart place: being content, though abſent from her beloved <hi>Calliſthenes,</hi> with that manner of life, in which yet at leaſt ſhe ſatisfied the naturall incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations of her generous freedom, being far from idleneſs the fomenter of vain thoughts, in the tender youth of Maids. And this her life alſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed her brothers, which would have her in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very thing conformed to their capriccio's, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move from her all hopes of marriage: The young <hi>Virago</hi> ſeeing her ſelf perſecuted alſo in that hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt liberty, and not brooking upon any terms to be deprived of that freedom of mind the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens had granted her, conceited, inexpert as ſhe was, that the onely flying into ſome other part, would inſtate her into ſuch a benefit. So having before in her hunting acquainted her ſelf with the tracks of thoſe forreſts, ſhe got away one day with an old ſhepherdeſſe from her other ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, and, diſguiſed in the habit of a young ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd, made towards the ſea-ſhoar; where, in a little fiſher-boat, ſhe croſt the Straits, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imbarking in <hi>Boeotia,</hi> and accidentally met upon the coaſts a company of Ladies, which there entertained the time in diſports: And ſhe arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in ſo fortunate an hour, that, liking well the deportment of <hi>Olympia,</hi> an antient Lady, and free alſo from all the Laws of Matrimony, ſhe diſcovered to her the ſecret of her quality, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treating her privacy and aſſiſtance. <hi>Olympia,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing taken with the noble confidence of the Maid, carried her to <hi>Thebes,</hi> the place of her abode,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:170451:38"/>and took her into the place of a daughter: and the greateſt part of her Dowry, lying within the circumference of this my Forreſt, ſhe often cometh hither with <hi>Argoſthenia,</hi> delighting much, to ſee her with ſuch a freedom and cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage to war with the wild-beaſts.</p>
            <p>But the Brothers miſt their Siſter, juſt at the inſtant that <hi>Calliſthenes,</hi> either for deſperation of ſeeing his Princeſſe condemned to that ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, or for the intereſt of his ſtudy, and chiefly by the impulſe of his deſtiny, was gone to <hi>Athens;</hi> they judged falſely, that ſhe was fled with him, and which was yet worſe, for to mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry her ſelfe, according to her inclinations. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, of three that were there, they commiting to <hi>Ariſtheus</hi> the ſecond of them, the care of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venging upon the innocent <hi>Caliſthenes</hi> the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended injury, he paſt immediatly to <hi>Athens;</hi> and ſeeking of <hi>Caliſthenes,</hi> he happened to his ill fortune, to encounter him juſt as he was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering into the houſe of the Embaſſador of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedonia,</hi> where he, and his three Aſſaſſinates fell upon him in the dark to murther him. <hi>Caliſthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,</hi> which would have expected any thing in the world, rather than to ſee his enemy <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtheus,</hi> being taken unprovided, he recommend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his ſafety to his flight, but in vain; for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtruck by the ruffians with two ſtabbs, one in the ſide, another in the head, he fell upon the threſhold of the houſe; where in a ſhort ſpace he expired, an innocent <hi>Victim</hi> of the guiltleſſe <hi>Argoſthenia.</hi> In the interim the whole family of the Embaſſador making thither at that noiſe, and ſeeing the Law of Nations violated,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:170451:38"/>which held the perſons and houſes of publick Miniſters in ſacred veneration, they fell upon <hi>Ariſtheus</hi> and his confederates, with ſuch reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, that though they long defended them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, they alſo became a ſacrifice to the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed <hi>Caliſthenes.</hi> The news of this Tragedy paſſing into <hi>Negroponte,</hi> the Father and Faction of <hi>Caliſthenes,</hi> though far inferiour to that of the Brethren of <hi>Argoſthenia,</hi> raiſed againſt them notwithſtanding ſo fierce a tempeſt of civill war, that they proceeded almoſt to the ſubduing that great City; but at laſt the families of <hi>Cali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſthenes,</hi> and the confederates with their parents were extirpated, and her younger brother alſo ſlain; a great part of whom, have been ever ſince baniſhed and diſperſed over all <hi>Greece.</hi> And theſe ſo deplorable miſeries, took begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning from this one prodigious Creature, ſhe having not any way contributed to it, unleſſe by a neceſſary flight to conſerve the liberty of her mind.</p>
            <p>Here the Knight held his peace, and I repli'd; But if an innocent Damſel be the occaſion of ſo many miſchiefs, Of what ruines may not a lewd woman make her ſelf the inſtrument? <hi>Lucinda</hi> may in part teſtifie it, added <hi>Arnaldo:</hi> Though yet (Heaven be praiſed) ſhe hath been more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe than unfaithfull; for if ſhe had been onely ungratefull to me, I had had no cauſe of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint, Ingratitude being a Dowry inſeparable from her Sex in ſuch a degree, <hi>That women al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes love thoſe that ſlight them, and abhor thoſe that adore them.</hi> But ſhe deſiring for her own deſigns to add ſubtilty to her infidelity; ſhe
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:170451:39"/>happened to plot a miſerable ruine, not ſo much to the prejudice of me, as to the detriment of Her ſelf, and her Lover. Here the dinner end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: The Knight aroſe from the table; and with a gentle pace took a walk under the ſhades of the Forreſt, through the ſame track which was made juſt before by <hi>Argoſthenia:</hi> and I ſeeing him taken up, would not with my curioſity in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupt his contemplations, but left him; when he himſelf was pleaſed to continue the Tragicall narration of his amorous adventures. Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding thus.</p>
            <p>After I had parted from <hi>Lucinda,</hi> with ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving for a ſupreme favour kiſt her hand, I was in ſo jocund an humour, as that if I had at that inſtant the Empire of the whole Univerſe, (and, I know, perfect Lovers will believe me) offered me in lieu of my contentment, I would have parted with it for the one half of my ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Whereupon <hi>Beliſa</hi> alſo taking comfort in my contentment, for the better continuing it, ſhe intreated me to go, for ſome dayes, to a Country-Seat of hers, but a league diſtant from the City of <hi>Thebes:</hi> whither, becauſe the place was very convenient for hunting and hawking, ſhe ſent many Falcons, to try if this new exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe, joyned with the favor received from <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinda,</hi> had been able to reſtore me to my former health and ſtrength. I entertained the time a few dayes in this retirement, beyond meaſure ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with the courteſie ſhewed me by <hi>Beliſa,</hi> who inveſtigated all the means poſſible to make me merry; but it was for no long time, in regard the Fates ordained the moments of my
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:170451:39"/>joy to be ſhort, and the continuance of my mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery to be laſting. It hapned therefore, that I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to go out one morning very early a Hunting; whileſt I prepared my ſelf to mount my Horſe, ſome ſiniſter Auguries would have predicted to me the vicinity of my misfortune: for the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, of clear and ſerene became on a ſudden clou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and dark; and a Gray hound which I loved ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly ran between my Legs, and began a dreadfull howling. But I, that was now all jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cund, and frollick for the favours received from <hi>Lucinda,</hi> valued not a ſtraw all theſe preſages, but would purſue my enterprize: and took a Falcon on my fiſt, and rid abroad into the fields: And here I was ſuddenly ſurprized with a ſtrange ſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering at the remembrance, that from the time of my being in the houſe of <hi>Jerſon</hi> till then, he had fled my company, and look't ſtrangely on me. And as I did think that the melancholly life I led, might have eſtranged him from my familiari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, I yet felt ſome confuſed impreſſions of ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour in my Soul, which pointed at ſome thing of more ſiniſter adventure.</p>
            <p>Now while I ſtood muſing in this conceit, my poor Falcon fell dead from my hand to the ground and now I was certain that this Omen foretold me ſome great evil touching this my friend; remembring at the ſame time, with more then ordinary compaſsion, the yelling my Gray-hound made in the morning. And here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon I deſired to return back to the houſe; when, (I know not how) I loſt my way, and, caſually lighting upon a little hillet, I diſcovered a rural habitation of <hi>Lucinda</hi>'s, from whence I thought I
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:170451:40"/>heard a murmuring noiſe of Muſical Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which reverberating in the concave of thoſe Mountains, ſent forth different Eccho's: Which thing ſeemed very ſtrange to me in the houſe of a maiden-Lady, eſpecially in that ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and in ſuch a place. Thereupon, with my Soul more then ever clouded by the paſsion of ſorrow which afflicted me, I came back at the ſhutting in of night to the houſe of my ſiſter. Who uſing at other times to meet me at the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner porch, was not now any where to be ſeen. I hereupon went to ſeek her in her Chamber, where I found her ſo dejected and ſad that ſhe could not utter a word. And I, in like manner, ſeeing her in that ſtate, durſt not ask her any thing, being fearfull of underſtanding ſome diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſing news. Yet at laſt, forced by Love, and my obligements, I intreated her to acquaint me with the occaſion of ſo unaccuſtomed, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found a melancholy. At which ſhe began ſo ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemently to weep, that it was not poſsible for her of a long time to ſpeak diſtinctly. But yet the extreamity of her grief being in part di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſhed, by the vent ſhe gave it in her tears, in the end ſhe ſaid; My deareſt brother, <hi>Jerſon</hi> and <hi>Lucinda</hi> have aſſaſsinated us both, <hi>Jerſon</hi> having long ſerved me, with pretext of obtaining me, (for other way he knew he had none) through the merit of thy friendſhip and of Love to mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry him; hath betrayed me to eſpouſe <hi>Lucinda:</hi> And <hi>Lucinda,</hi> now when ſhe ſeemed moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placent to thee, hath moſt perfidiouſly deceived thee to marry <hi>Jerſon.</hi> And ſo we are both wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the moſt ſenſible part of our reputation;
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:170451:40"/>without poſsibility of pretending to a ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction equivalent to ſuch an injury. When I underſtood this news, <hi>Beliſa</hi> being able no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to continue her diſcourſe, I interrupted her with ſo profound ſighs &amp; ſhrieks, that I thought thereby to breathe out my dolorous Soul. And I verily believe, that 'tis impoſsible for a man to die of ſorrow, ſince I am able to live under the afflictions of ſuch diſgraces. Yet indeed I was wounded with what reſembled death. Anon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter I returned to my ſelf, and rent the Letter ſent me by the inflexible <hi>Lucinda</hi> into a thouſand bits, entring into ſuch deſperation, that even to the tearing my hair from my head, I committed the moſt indecent acts of womaniſh weakneſſe: it being but too true, <hi>That a Soul overpaſſionate in the love of a woman, changeth his manly courage into effeminate cowardice.</hi> I forbare for ſome dayes to efface this grief out of my breaſt, till I might aſſure my ſelf of ſome conſtant reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Then cloathing all my family in mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, I ſent <hi>Jerſon</hi> a Chartel of Defiance in theſe terms.</p>

            <p>WHen Arms had been thus denounced a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt me, I went to the King, to whom having related my cauſe, and the treachery of <hi>Jerſon,</hi> he freely granted me the field. The day
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:170451:42"/>deſtined to the battle being come, we both pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented our ſelves before the King, and took the wonted Oath, and our Arms being view'd by the Judges, we entred into the Liſt: where we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countred in our Carier with ſuch impetuoſity, that we eaſily knew the little advantage we ſhould get of each other. <hi>Jerſon</hi> therefore, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no leſſe dextrous than skilfull in horſ-man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, aſſaulted me on the arme that was naked, giving me a dangerous wound I muſt needs ſay, I ſtruck him onely on the Viſour of his Cask without doing him any hurt. Yet nevertheleſſe the Launces flew in pieces: then we preſently took our ſwords, and began to aſſault one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with ſuch reſolution, and our fight endured ſo long, that the eyes of the Spectators were as weary of beholding us, as we were with fighting. Yet in the end the lot fell in favour of the right, and <hi>Jerſon</hi> was diſmounted and ſlain: and ſo <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinda</hi>'s infidelity came to be known, and my cauſe approved. Yet nevertheleſſe, eſteeming his own honour, and that of his houſe, more than life, he would not in any caſe confeſſe his default, but preferred a valiant death before a ſhamefull and diſhonourable life. Thus <hi>Lucinda</hi> in the ſpace of a moneth after her marriage, made in my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, and to the betraying of my ſiſter, became a Widow, <hi>Jerſon</hi> was chaſtiſed, I a Conquerour, right was vindicated, and infidelity puniſhed.</p>
            <p>Here the Knight having ſtayed his diſcourſe, I congratulated with him ſo glorious a victory obtained over ſo perfidious, together with ſo valiant, an Enemy. Then the Cavalier ſigh'd from the bottom of his heart, and ſaid. Too dear I
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:170451:42"/>paid, Noble Stranger, for ſo famous a victory; for in acquiring to my ſelf the applauſe of valour, I came to procure an infinite deal of ſorrow: having eternally loſt her whom I hoped to win in ſo great a field of courage and fidelity. For, not being yet cured of my infirmity, I made over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures by divers friends &amp; kinsfolks (ſo was I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amoured on her) to <hi>Lucinda,</hi> that entreating ſhe would pardon the offence done her upon the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of honour againſt my will, ſhe would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent (though now ſhe was not worthy of my bed and company) to receive me in the room of her deceaſed Conſort. To which being alwayes averſe, ſhe ſhut her ears, ſetling her ſelf in this cruel approbation, not onely of not gratifying me with marriage, but of not ſurviving her be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved <hi>Jerſon.</hi> Seeing therefore that I ſpent all my attempts in vain, I would for my laſt proof, and ultimate diſgrace, make uſe of the perſon of <hi>Beliſa:</hi> Who, though ſhe was very unwilling, yet knew not how to deny at my requeſt to ſeek to ſo ill-beloved a woman, but try'd to ſee if at her entreaty ſhe would receive me into favour; which, beſides bloud, and fortune, having alſo made my ſelf a known Superiour in valour to her deceaſed husband, I was not doubtleſſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy in a ſecond place to poſſeſſe her affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. <hi>Lucinda</hi> underſtanding by the mouth of <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſa</hi> ſuch like remonſtrances, ſhe diſturbedly ſaid to her: My friend, follow me, and I will give you the anſwer you require of me: So they went together to a building of the Ladies, ſeparated from the common offices of life, and, entring the ſame according to the freedom of our Countreys,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:170451:43"/>they came juſt into that part, where <hi>Jerſon</hi> lay enterr'd in the hereditary Sepulcher of her greateſt Anceſtors, founders of that ſtructure. Whither being come with her Governeſſe, and other Ladies of her acquaintance, <hi>Lucinda</hi> firſt ſtedfaſtly beheld the Sepulcher, and after turning to <hi>Beliſa,</hi> tartly ſaid.</p>
            <p>See the nuptials prepared me by your brother! And that ſaying, with a ſharp Dagger which ſhe carried hid in her ſlieve, ſhe barbarouſly ſtabb'd her ſelf in the breaſt, to tranfix in her life my Soul, and the comfort of all my hopes. She did not die preſently, yet did not ſurvive many hours, ſo deſperate was her reſolution to be a perpetual companion in death of him, whoſe company ſhe had enjoyed but few hours in life. The horror of ſuch a ſpectacle, put ſuch affliction and terror into the mind of <hi>Beliſa,</hi> that it being accompanied with the fear of ſeeing me alſo fall in her, as not deſiring to ſurvive this her death, ſhe fell into a deep ſwound, in which ſhe long continued, like one really dead; &amp; being not able to reſiſt ſo great a dyſaſter, ſhe alſo ended the courſe of her dayes with a ſhort fickneſſe, in the moſt goodly flower of her youth, and hath left me Heir of a perpetual death; few nights paſſing me in which ſhe comes not to diſquiet my ſleep with horrid apparitions and diſcourſes of death. I think therefore that the end of my calamity is not far off; for but yeſterday ſhe appeared to me about break of day, telling me, that there would arrive at my houſe, (and you are the deareſt Gueſt) from the Weſtern parts a Stranger, which would one day tranſmit to the memory of Poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:170451:43"/>the Tragical Hiſtory of our miſerable ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventures; And bring me withall a change of my fortune, which I am certain cannot be but by changing this turmoyled life into the tranquil repoſe of death.</p>

            <p>HEre ſtopt the Knight, and I ſubjoyned. I would have you hope for more fortunate Auguries, which not my arrival in theſe parts, but the benignity of deſtiny ſhall preſent you with, gentle Sir; which is that which the information you have given me, hath juſt now infuſed into my mind of the beautifull Huntreſſe, through whoſe tracks we now direct our ſteps. For if I deceive not my ſelf in the little knowledge I have taken, more from the experience of Mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dane revolutions, than the ſtudy of any abſtruſe ſciences; I ſee not onely in your looks, but read alſo in the internal tablet of your heart a mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellous correſpondency of Genius between your noble perſon, and that of <hi>Argoſthenia.</hi> And, Who knoweth but that <hi>Heaven,</hi> which <hi>by the means of women hath effected the greateſt benefits in the World;</hi> hath ſent this fair Stranger out of <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gropont</hi> into <hi>Baeotia,</hi> for no other end but by the aſsiſtance of her perſon to terminate your ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings; taking you from this dolefull ſolitude wherein you are unprofitable to others, and a burden to your ſelf, to tranſport you to a place,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:170451:44"/>and eſtate worthy of the dignity of your bloud, and the grandure of your mind?</p>
            <p>Here the Knight ſtedfaſtly beheld me with ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent ſeriouſneſſe, letting looſe unawares many profound things; whereupon I proſecuted my diſcourſe, ſaying. <hi>Negropont</hi> already bewails the ruine of the ſtock of its <hi>Princes,</hi> reduced into the ſole perſon of <hi>Doricinia: Periander,</hi> elder bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of <hi>Argoſthenia,</hi> to whom by primogeniture that inheritance doth belong, hath given the final period to that family: For, rebelling in an amorous diſdain againſt the Durcheſſe, who ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to conſerve her ſelf free and independent, would not marry; or for that ſhe knew <hi>Periander</hi> to be of too turbulent a <hi>Genius,</hi> and two tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical a diſpoſition, had refuſed to make him her husband; he hath for the ſame merited exile from <hi>Negropont,</hi> as a reward of his inſurrections; and according to the report, which goes of him is dead in the Iſle of <hi>Andros,</hi> whither he had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took himſelf with the deplorable Reliques of his Rebellion. The eldeſt ſiſter likewiſe of <hi>Argoſthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia</hi> is without any of the fruits of her Matrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny: ſo that if Heaven permit that alſo the Dutcheſſe ſhould run the great Carier of death without legitimate iſſue; the government of that Noble principality would deſcend directly to <hi>Argoſthenia:</hi> And what would you ſay, gentle Sir, if you, changing your fortune with the mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of your life, ſhould paſſe, by the means of ſo prodigious a Lady, from the deſarts of <hi>Boeotid</hi> to the Throne of <hi>Calcides?</hi> And whereas now you lye buried an unprofitable burden to the world in the Sepulcher of a Forreſt, you
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:170451:44"/>would return to live in publick, to the glory of our age? What pretend ye to with ſuch anxie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, for an extinguiſh'd Beauty, that you ſo much love her? Is it haply with hopes to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive her, that ſhe may again return to torment you? That's an enterprize wholly unworthy of your prudence; For <hi>Lucinda</hi> ſhall never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn more to the earth. And although the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles of antiquity might be renewed, and ſhe ſhould riſe again, Do you preſume, peradventure, that ſhe with her nature changed, would riſe fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable and faithful? It would be a folly to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magine it. For a perſon dead, therefore, which firſt with betraying you for another perſon, and after with dying, hath thereby confeſſed her ſelf unworthy of you, would you caſt away your ſelf by leading a life, no better than a perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall death; depriving your illuſtrious family, this Kingdom, and your ſelf, of the glory of your proweſſe, to the good of mankind? Such gifts of Heaven ſo prodigally ſhowred down up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on your gentle perſon, ought theſe, I ſay, to be ſo miſerably abuſed by a vain paſſion, to the unexpreſſible detriment of your renowned blood, of the age, and of your ſelf? Ah Sir, re-aſſume at laſt, reaſſume thoſe generous ſpirits, which your birth inſtilled into your breaſt, and by your birth, Heaven; and if ſo miſerable a loſſe of your high honours, hath been overpaſt by a weak inamoured youthfulneſſe; let the glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous reparation of a maturer age, dart out of theſe ſhaddows into the noble ſerenitie of brave enterpriſes: For if in youth its a leſs ſhame to err; more glorious alſo will the redreſſe of
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:170451:45"/>thoſe errors appear, which would environ your temples with the crown of a moſt noble princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pality. To this mutation of life and fortune, the benigne Ghoſt of your ſiſter counſells you; and to this, by the aid of <hi>Argoſthenia,</hi> Deſtiny inviteth you; which, for no other cauſe, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted that you ſhould be deprived of <hi>Lucinda</hi> by her own Infidelity, but for to open you the way, which ſhe would perpetually have ſhut up to you, of paſſing from the deſarts of <hi>Boeotia</hi> to the Throne of <hi>Negropont.</hi>

In that part therefore which pertains to the invalidity of my griefs for an exanimate and faithleſſe beauty, the cauſe of ſo many miſeries to me; I ſhould eaſily be brought to acknowledg my ſimplicity occaſioned by a falſe opinion fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in my head by youthfull Vanity, and a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholly conſtitution that took root in my birth, and is now almoſt converted into Nature, by the infelicity of my tragicall adventures. But of the novelties ſucceeded in the Principa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of <hi>Negroponte,</hi> of the exile and death of <hi>Periander,</hi> and his ſiſter, and of the right of <hi>Argoſthenia</hi> to that Crown, as alſo of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſion I might nouriſh towards her perſon, it's not neceſſary we ſhould diſcourſe with ſuch confuſion, and haſte; but rather let us find out a time and place to inform our ſelves of neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:170451:45"/>contingences: For though we ſhould ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that I did propound, and that <hi>Argoſthenia</hi> ſhould not reject this match; yet it would be good to know, if the Dutcheſſe would conſent, that a Lady, who is not known ſo much as to be in the World, ſhould ſucceed her in the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipality. And, were we certain ſhe would ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge her, and conſent that ſhe ſucceed her, yet is it a queſtion whether ſhe would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit her to match her ſelf into the houſe of a ſtrange Knight; which may pretend by right of blood, to the ſucceſſion of the Kingdom of <hi>Thebes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here <hi>Arnaldo</hi> held his peace, and I replied: Sir, <hi>He who too critically diſtinguiſheth in grand enterprizes, doth fruſtrate them before they be half effected.</hi> It's good therefore that prudence take place, but yet it's neceſſary to leave ſomething to the arbitrament of Fortune.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Argoſthenia</hi> already holds by birth a right to aſpire, after the Dutcheſſe, to the Crown of <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cides,</hi> nor can all the violence in the World de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive her of this right of nature. She liveth not at preſent at the Dutcheſſe's diſpoſall, which as yet doth not know in what part of the world ſhe is conceal'd; or rather hath forgot all thoughts of her perſon, as if ſhe had never been born. Let us ſay nothing to the young Lady of this ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret, and let us onely with the help of <hi>Olympia,</hi> drive on your marriage with her; for, this done, we ſhall have time enough afterwards, of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſing ſo grand a ſecret, and of imparting the truth to the Dutcheſſe; who when ſhe ſhall hear that ſhe is already eſpouſed to a Cavalier ſo
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:170451:46"/>well accompliſhed, will have no occaſion for which to repute her unworthy of Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to the Principality, through the ſuſpitions which their flight might beget in the minds of the people, as if that, for actions unworthy of her, ſhe had fled from <hi>Negropont.</hi> Then, as to the right of birth which you alſo pretend to the Crown of <hi>Thebes;</hi> the intereſts of State will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare in your favour: giving you a ground to hope one day by means of this match, if not in your perſon, in that of your deſcendents, to unite all theſe Provinces under one onely Crown; For although, by reaſon the Kingdom of <hi>Thebes</hi> is far greater than the Dukdom of <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gropont,</hi> there might ſome obſtacle ariſe from the fear of becoming of a Soveraign State, a ſubſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate Province, there would not want oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune means to adjuſt ſuch differences by aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the <hi>Calcidonians</hi> that they ſhould never be commanded by <hi>Theban</hi> Miniſters as ſubjects, but ſhould be alwayes governed as a free State, by perſons of the Royall Family. But ſuch like conſiderations are at preſent unſeaſonable; and it ſhall ſuffice to know, that there never want evaſions and pretexts for Soveraigns, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with they may ſatisfie the pretenſions of the people. The point on which your prudence ought to inſiſt, is, to rouſe your ſelf out of this unprofitable obſcurity; and to procure the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liance of <hi>Argoſthenia,</hi> before that the news from <hi>Calcides</hi> of her family do arive to her notice. Leave the reſt to the care of Heaven, of Fortune, and of your own Valour.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Arnaldo</hi> hearing this, replyed: Friend, He
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:170451:46"/>that adviſeth to any enterprize, ſhould know, above all things, how to inveſtigate the means requiſite to execute it.</p>
            <p>If you think a Marriage with <hi>Argoſthenia,</hi> to be a good act in me; I will confeſſe that ſhe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready is poſſeſt with ſome inclinations in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of my perſon; and that <hi>Olympia</hi> being my Mother's ſiſter, may promiſe us all good ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe. To you I refer my ſelf, and becauſe we are juſt at the bounds of my Foreſt, and upon the paſſing into that of <hi>Olympia,</hi> I will return to my houſe, and you may, as Conductor of my people, who cary <hi>Argoſthenia</hi> her prey, intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce your ſelf into the acquaintance of that La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. That will ſuffice, and this will ſerve you for a Token of ſecurity with <hi>Olympia,</hi> that you treat with her by my conſent about ſuch a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition: And ſo ſaying, he took a Diamond from his finger, and put it upon mine.</p>
            <p>I received it, and taking my leave of the Knight, forded the Brook, with the conduct of four ſervants, which carried to <hi>Argoſthenia,</hi> upon a rurall Barrow of ſticks, the Stagg that ſhe had ſlain.</p>
            <p>As ſoon as I had ſet foot upon the champain, I thought that the liberty of the open air did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleniſh my ſoul with unuſuall reſentments of joy, in ſuch manner, that they wholly removed the remembrances of all paſt dyſaſters, fixing me onely in the thoughts of my preſent occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, giving me a certain proof of the bounty of Heaven, being ſo far ſeparated from my Native Country; in that, though my heart was not, yet at leaſt my fortune was changed by the alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the Climate.</p>
            <pb n="76" facs="tcp:170451:47"/>
            <p>I came by Sun-ſet to the houſe of <hi>Olympia,</hi> a proud Structure, which would better have enno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled a great City, than ſuch a ſalvage habitation; I found her buried in an abyſſe of grief and tears, for the wanting, the joy of her eyes, the fair <hi>Argoſthenia;</hi> which loſing her way (as was ſuppoſed) after the chaſe of that Stagg, which we brought life-leſſe to her houſe, was no more ſeen of all that day. Whereupon diſpatching all her people in ſearch of her, ſhe ſate alone with her women to condole the ſuſpition of ſome un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expected dyſaſter. I was ſo much ſurpriſed at this ſpectacle, that I loſt in the very enterance of my deſign the thread, by which I was to weave the webb, recommended me by the <hi>Injur'd Lover;</hi> for that was the name, which out of thoſe woods was born by <hi>Arnaldo.</hi> Yet I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plemented with the Lady in terms befitting her nobility and my duty, endeavouring to comfort her, but in vain: for night had already enrob'd it's ſelf in gloomy ſhades, and her domeſticks were returned from the queſt of the Lady, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any news of her perſon, which precipitated her into ſuch grief, and drew from her ſo great lamentation, that it would have moved to pitty the inſenſible hardneſſe of ſtones. Whereupon, being grown deſperate at this incounter, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the ſummer ſeaſon permitted me to travel in the night, the ſervants of <hi>Arnaldo</hi> being diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt, I diſpoſed my ſelf never to return thither without having firſt learnt ſome tidings of the loſt Lady. I had obſerved in my walke with the Knight, the hollowings of barbarous voyces in certain parts of the Forreſt; but, tranſported by
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:170451:47"/>the current of our diſcourſe, I took no great notice of it for that time; ſeeing that none of the Cavaliers followers were in the leaſt moved at it, or expreſt the leaſt alteration: So it came in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to my thought to re-paſſe thither. And though I wanted the clue of <hi>Ariadne</hi> to guide me, in the night, through the Labyrinth of ſuch thickets: yet I made uſe of ſome obſervations I had made in ſome groves of <hi>Italy,</hi> to know the tracks of men and beaſts, and I reſolved pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently to depart. But I had ſcarce ſet foot in the Forreſt, when me-thought I heard the mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mure of paſſengers; whence, not certain whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they might be men or beaſts, I layd hold of my ſword, and ſecuring my head with my Helmet, I withdrew my ſelf behind the root of a vaſt Oak, encompaſſed by a little thicket of young Oakes, newly grown, to obſerve the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages of this encounter; it being a piece of fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, rather than valour, to run into perills and dangers, without any reaſon or neceſſity. And ſcarce was I provided with that ſanctuary of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity, when I perceived, more by the ſound of the ear, than by the diſcernment of the eye, that they were men that paſſed that way, and I fancied to hear one of them ſay: We have made a good booty, but it will be neceſſary we get out of theſe <hi>Purly's</hi> before day, otherwiſe we run a hazard of being diſcovered. Hearing this, I began preſently to imagine, that this prey was no other than <hi>Argoſthenia.</hi> Hereupon letting them ſcarce paſſe ſo far as not to diſcover me, I put my ſelf into the path they took, to follow them.</p>
            <pb n="78" facs="tcp:170451:48"/>
            <p>But ſcarce had I gone three hundred paces, when they ſtopt at the mouth of a Grott, where they endeavoured to take away ſome impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of loggs and ſtones, which barracado'd it; the which while they were intent to do, one of them felt himſelf wounded with ſo ſound a blow, that crying he was ſlain, he fell goaning to the earth. And whilſt another of the knot would require of him, What was the matter, I ſaw him alſo ran through the breſt with a boar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpear, and tumbled cloſe by the other. There re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained two others, the which ſtept back, and drew their ſwords, putting themſelves upon their defence, asking, What Devill was deſcended down there, in the little ſpace they had been gone? Then <hi>Argoſthenia</hi> skipt out of that Cave with a ſpear in her hand, exclaiming: Ah Traitors! It's the Juſtice of Heaven that ſmites you. Now I have untyed thoſe hands your villany bound. And that ſaying, made at them, and hurt one of them in the face: and after that, leaping over thoſe obſtacles of blocks and ſtones, betook her ſelf to flight, through thoſe tracks, wherewith ſhe was very well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted; The two Aſſaſſinats ſeeing that, ran after her to ſtay her: hereupon, ſeeing that now was the time to diſcover my ſelf in relief of that Lady; I purſued them, reproaching them with that barbariſm. <hi>Argoſthenia</hi> heard me before the Aſſaſſinates, and, animated by that unexpected ſuccour, ſhe turned head againſt them with admirable undauntedneſs; ſo that the two ruf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fians being engaged betwixt the Ladie's ſpear and my ſword, they could not eſcape their deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:170451:48"/>deaths. Howbeit they did not dye unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venged; for I received a blow upon the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, upon the border of my murrion, and a deep ſtabb in the left arm, and hand. <hi>Argoſthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia</hi> in like manner, had a reverſe ſo great upon the head, that if it had fallen edgewiſe, as it did flat, all the hope of <hi>Arnaldo</hi> had faln to the earth, with that blow. Yet did ſhe fall in a ſwound; whereupon, I not knowing in ſo great a deſtitution of all things, with what other ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument to provide for her, whiſpered ſome charms ſoftly to her, and made her come to her ſelf; but ſo ill ſhe was, that ſhe had no appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of her ſelf. Yet in the end re-aſſuming her proper knowledge, ſhe requeſted me to tell her, Who I was: and having told her, ſhe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt an inconceivable ſatisfaction, and cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſly preſenting me her hand, aroſe from the ground, ſaying; Let us walk Sir, for I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing very well accuſtomed in the wayes, will bring you in leſſe than an hour to the houſe of <hi>Arnaldo;</hi> for to that of <hi>Olympia</hi> I will return by my ſelf as ſoon as day breaks. No, Madam, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered I, It is convenient that we go firſt to that of <hi>Olympia,</hi> for ſhe is ſubmerged in an ocean of perplexities for fear of you. After you have obliged me for my life, you would al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo overcome me in Civility, anſwered the Lady. But that you ſhall not do; for you had need to have your wounds dreſt, if you well obſerve your left arm, and I feel nothing but a ſlight blow on the head, which amounts to nothing; ſo that it's requiſite, that we go to the neereſt houſe. And beſide, I would not that the fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:170451:49"/>of <hi>Olympia</hi> ſhould ſee you with me, whilſt the aire of your face, and the faſhion of your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portment falſifie the modeſty, which otherwiſe I ſee in your countenance, &amp; obſerve in your man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners. I then interrupted her: Theſe conſiderations are of no effect, now that I am juſt come from the houſe of <hi>Olympia</hi> to ſeek you, and muſt treat with her about ſome affairs, which I hope will ſucceed to your ſatisfaction alſo. Here the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy leaping with a ſudden alacrity, ſaid; And what is it? Perhaps you bring me ſome news from <hi>Negroponte?</hi> Is it happily that the Tyrant my brother is dead? I would have you, Madam, retain more comfortable thoughts, anſwered I; Be to your brother what will, you ſhall not want a fortune, if you know how to entertain it.</p>
            <p>Calamities I conceive I may expect (replied the young Lady) in this my miſerable life, onely made tolerable by my Genius, which will not give place in any reſpect to fortune, and as the miſadventure even now hapned to me may give ſome proof: but of fortunate adventures I nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther apprehend them, nor do I hope for them. And how then (ſaid I) came you into this danger? I know not very well (ſaid the youthfull Lady) how to relate it, yet I ſhall acquaint you in brief, with that which befell me: and (by the way I muſt tell you) I have ever obſerved hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, that I am moſt merry when I am accoſted with ſome unexpected dyſaſter. Departing therefore from your Company ſomewhat joyed, for having found the Cavalier <hi>Arnaldo</hi> in a manner of car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage and looks, unuſual to his lugubrious me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy,
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:170451:49"/>I forgat my way: but I had not gone above a thouſand paces, when I ſaw theſe villains ſtart out of certain craggy places; and before I perceived my ſelf aſſaulted, I found I was bound, and carried to the Grot, whence I am now eſcap't. Which, having ſerved heretofore either for an habitation of people, or for ſome reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Rites, within is very commodious, and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacious enough for eight or ten perſons. Here, I had, juſt before I came to you, left this my Hunting ſpear, and one of my upper Garments, recommending them to a ſhepheard which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied me, to run the faſter with my Bow after the Stag, which I ſlew at your feet. Here alſo theſe men tied me faſter then before, that I might not make uſe of my hands, blocking me up in ſuch a manner as you might have eaſily ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, getting together a great number of logs and ſtones, to fill up the mouth of the cave. With what intention they did this, they would not tell me. Onely I collected, that they would expect the night to take me hence unobſerved, and carry me to <hi>Thebes;</hi> for as much as I ſuſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted this Crime of Treaſon was deſcended from <hi>Diambres,</hi> a principal Cavalier among the <hi>Thebane</hi> Nobility; who having long ſerved and ſolici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted me in vain, ſeeing the uglineſſe of his face and the rudeneſſe of his diſpoſition could not diſpoſe me to affect him; he would have raviſhed me, to obtain that from me with violence, which he could never poſſeſſe himſelf of, by Love.</p>
            <p>Seeing my ſelf therefore included in this Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern, <hi>Neceſſity,</hi> the wiſe School-Miſtreſſe of our ſafety, taught me the manner how to break my
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:170451:50"/>bonds; for I drew neer the edge and points of ſome ſtones, and I endeavoured in ſuch ſort to fret the cords and ſtrings (that bound my arms to my ſides) againſt them, that ſo getting theſe looſe firſt, I might break alſo thoſe that tied together my hands. Seeing my ſelf at liberty, and with my ſpear, I skipt with ſuch joy, that I thought every minute a thouſand years, that the Ruffians delayed to clear the enterance of the Grotto, which work I often attempted my ſelf, but I found it altogether impoſſible, by reaſon of the too great bulk, and heavineſſe of that Barricado of Trees and Stones accumulated by the ſtrength of four men, which a weak woman was not able to remove. Now, praiſed be the Heavens, that by their benignity and your ſuccour, I am again in poſſeſſion of my liberty, for I would certainly far rather die a thouſand times, than ſee my ſelf in the power of the deformed <hi>Diambres,</hi> whom I hate more then death. I would not for that time multiply Complements to aſcribe her liberty to her own valour, more than my ſlow ſuccour; but ſeeing her pauſe at theſe words: But Madam, ſaid I, all are not <hi>Diamrbes</hi>'s, ſo that you ſhould deſite to live always ſingle. And even this peril which you have juſt now run through, ought to advertiſe you to provide for the ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of your perſon; (which being ſo beautifull will be ever obnoxious to treacheries) by chu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing a husband worthy of you. Here the ſpright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Laſſe with an inconſiderate geſture of pure freedom, void of all deceit, ſaid; Sir Knight, if you peradventure be he, which by believing to have obliged me, ſhall deſire me for your wife;
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:170451:50"/>content your ſelf, that I tell you, that I ſhall ever confeſſe my obligation; nor do your qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities a jot diſpleaſe me: but having already de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated my Soul to another, it is not conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient I beſtow on you this miſerable part of my ſelf, which though fair that it is, may by a light indiſpoſition be ſoon deformed, and chang'd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to uglineſſe. Hereupon I rejoyced exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly at the ſo ingenuous freedom of the Lady, and added; Madam, I aſſure you, I have not ſpoke for my ſelf ſo much, becauſe my deſtiny hath already bound me in other Chains, as becauſe I am conſcious of my incapacity of ſuch a favour, exceeding the ſlenderneſſe of my fortune; but I have ſpoke to other ends more worthy of the Nobility of your birth, and the generoſity of your ſpirit. You wrong your ſelf ſaid the Lady, and withall offend my modeſty; for had I my Soul at liberty, and you ſhould then nouriſh ſuch pretenſions, I would not a jot reſpect Fortune, but would conſider your accompliſhments, and my obligements: for other then your ſelf, I am ſure you treat not for; being a Stranger, newly ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived in this Countrey, &amp; having never known me before to day, I am confident you ſpeak for none but your ſelf. Let us turn our diſcourſe to ſome other matter, and content your ſelf, that there paſſe between us onely a bare correſpondence of ſincere friendſhip, and pure endearments.</p>
            <p>You honour me too much, gentle Madam, ſaid I! And in ſo ſhort a ſpace of time, as I have known you; I am preſented with an occaſion to intreat your favour in behalf of another. And what is he, ſaid <hi>Argoſthenia?</hi> One that perhaps
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:170451:51"/>will not diſpleaſe you, added I. But I would firſt treat with <hi>Olympia.</hi> The Lady ſigh'd, and ſaid, <hi>Olympia</hi> is my Lady, but I am Lady of my ſelf in this particular. Therefore tell me what you are to ſay to <hi>Olympia;</hi> for beſides that your ſuit concerns none but my ſelf, I pretend no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing from <hi>Olympia,</hi> and may pretend much from my own family. I added, The Knight my Hoſt is he that deſires you for your ſelf, and that will ſhew you the reaſon alſo of that which he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects from you. The young Lady ſigh'd, and gave a ſudden ſtart, ſaying to me, <hi>Arnaldo?</hi> Yes, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, ſaid I: At my perſwaſion he deſires you to ſucceed with a more propitious fortune in the place of his ingratefull <hi>Lucinda.</hi> So then, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned <hi>Argoſthenia,</hi> I am doubly obliged; in my life, and in my contentment: without having done any thing to oblige you to ſo generous, and endearing favours. It's the duty of all high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born Souls (ſaid I) to procure the benefit of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, eſpecially of Ladies of your quality. When you pleaſe therefore <hi>Arnaldo</hi> ſhall be your husband, and I a ſervant to you both: Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther rather, ſaid <hi>Argoſthenia;</hi> for to a Gentleman of ſo noble, and generous qualities, a title ſo ignoble &amp; vile as that of ſervant doth not agree. But how may I believe you (excuſe my indiſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion being tranſported beyond my ſelf) that <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naldo</hi> commiſſionated you to ſuch a treaty? I ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly replied, Behold here, Madam, this Ring (and preſented it to her) which you have often ſeen on his finger, and this he preſents you as the pledge of his paſſion. The Lady took it with a ſmile, ſaying; Now my obligements to you are
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:170451:51"/>ſo incomparable, that I want a conceit to appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend them, and language to thank you for them. Tell <hi>Arnaldo</hi> that <hi>Argoſthenia</hi> was born either to be enjoyed by <hi>Arnaldo,</hi> or elſe onely by death. Chooſe he what he pleaſeth, for I am content, whether it be with him, or with it.</p>
            <p>You ſhall do me the favour to carry back to him this Collanet (and pulled it from her neck) with my Picture, that he may keep it ſo much the neerer his heart, as he is the heart of my breaſt, the ſpirit of my Soul. Then, in giving it to me, ſhe ſtayd her hand on mine, adding, Sir, <hi>Argo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſthenia</hi> cannot give you a greater proof of the obligations ſhe profeſſeth to owe you.</p>
            <p>I then kiſt that hand of this courteous and ingenious Creature, acknowledging ſuch ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours to be infinite favours: aſſuring her, to the utmoſt of ſo inconſiderable a fortune and ability, a perpetuall obſervance and fidelity to her perſon, and to the Knight her Spouſe.</p>
            <p>Whether it was the obſcurity of the night, (become greater by a little miſling ſhower which began to bedew the tracks of the Forreſt); or elſe the apprehenſion of the things we diſcourſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of I know not, but ſo it happened, that <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goſthenia</hi> led us out of the way, nor did ſhe perceive it, till that being tired by the walk, ſhe took notice ſhe was nigh to the murmure of a Brook, which begirt the Forreſt about; whereat being ſurpriz'd with a chilneſſe ſhe ſaid, Sir, by my careleſneſſe, we are ſo wandered out of our way, that we are above ſeven miles from the houſe of <hi>Olympia,</hi> and four from that of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naldo.</hi> To return at this hour, and from this
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:170451:52"/>place, into the Forreſt would be an expoſing our ſelves to a manifeſt peril of our lives, being we muſt paſſe through ſome great Valleys inhabited onely by Wolves; and if we would croſſe the Brook, and walk towards the houſe of <hi>Olympia,</hi> we muſt alſo wander three miles in the Forreſt along the Banks of this River, before we can find a place to ford it; it being very large as you ſee, and full of quick Sands and Rocks in theſe parts. Pardon me, I intreat you, this errour commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted caſually againſt my will; and do me the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to lend me ſomething to cover my head, that the rain may not ulcerate my wound, which I find to be already much ſwelled. Hearing her ſay ſo, I pulled from under my Coat a large Taf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faty Scarf, and preſented her with it, and alſo a Handkerchief, expreſſing my grief not to be ſo much at the miſſing of the way, as at the pains which thereby ſhe was put to. Upon which the Lady replied: Yet cannot I do any thing to ſhew the ſenſe your obligements impreſſe in me; though I would willingly dedicate the better half of my dayes to return part of that acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement, which the Laws of gratitude doth with juſtice exact for ſo ſupream a favour, and ſo high a content, as your preſence hath poſſeſt me of. But that which adds to my grief, is, that you, having need of repoſe, and remedy to your wounds, do by this foggy aire of the night exaſperate them afreſh.</p>
            <p>Whilſt ſhe was talking thus, and her hands were imployed about the binding up and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering her head, her foot ſlid by reaſon of the ſlipperineſſe of the ground, occaſioned through
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:170451:52"/>the exceſſive rain that had faln, and ſo ſhe tumb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led into a deep plaſh of water, made by the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of the Current in that part. It was the goodneſſe of Heaven that ſhe ſhould fall di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly upon her feet, otherwiſe ſhe had ran the danger of bruiſing her ſelf, on certain ſplin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the ſtump of a tree, cut down upon the bank of that river. And it was alſo a happy turn, that the charity of the neighbouring ſtream did reflect ſome little duskiſh light in the aire, that I might thereby find out the way to recover her from that precipice: The which I finally did, though with great difficulty; for ſhe through the fright of the fall was ſo bereft of force, that ſhe was altogether unable to walk. Being forced therefore by neceſsity, as if ſhe had been a little Child, I took her in my arms; and ſhe, weeping with tenderneſſe, for her faſter-ſitting put her left arm about my neck, ſaying to me; Sir, Neceſsity violates all Laws. I am in your arms, but I am <hi>Arnaldo</hi>'s ſpouſe; Let it pleaſe you therefore that this imbracement be of a ſiſter to her brother, to whom ſhe confeſſes to owe her life a thouſand times. I being moved with pity, and the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſity together of the young Lady, was almoſt ready to weep, replying; I know very well Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam what a Gentleman's duty is towards a Lady of your merit; and to a friend, of the quality of <hi>Arnaldo.</hi> Make the ſame accompt of me, as if I were truely that which you pleaſe to term me, your brother; ſince age conſents not that I call you daughter. So I will, I aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſſure you anſwered ſhe; and reſting for feeble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe one cheek upon my head, made me think
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:170451:53"/>her ſo light, that I ſcarce felt the weight of her body.</p>
            <p>Walking in this manner, about half a mile, my ear was alarm'd with a ſlow murmur of humane voices; whereupon hearkning towards that part I perceived they were fiſher-men, which caſting baits to the fiſhes ſtood ſilently expecting, that they would run to the ſame to ſwallow them. Making therefore to the brink of the Brook, I called them to waft me over to the Champain. They, like rude and ſimple people, very unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly conſented to it, as loath to deprive them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of the ſorry prey which they expected in their Nets. Whereupon perceiving this their wretched avidity, I invited them by a promiſe of rewarding them with a benefit more worth then a hundred ſuch fiſh. They hearing that, turned their Boat to the place where we were, &amp; to our misfortune landed us on the other ſide. To our misfortune, I ſay: for having with the dawn of the new-born day diſcovered at a little diſtance from us, the Towers of a Caſtle founded upon a little Hill, juſt when that <hi>Argoſthenia</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving received part of her ſtrength, might be able to walk, we directed our ſteps towards that place with hope to find harbour and relief; I for my wounds, <hi>Argoſthenia</hi> for her weakneſſe. But ſcarce had we begun to mount the riſe of the Hill, when on the inſtant there came towards us out of the Gate of the Caſtle, a tumultuous Troop of perſons, ſome on Horſe-back, and ſome on foot: among which <hi>Argoſthenia</hi> having diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered <hi>Diambres,</hi> with a look betwixt furious and diſdainfull, ſhe betook herſelf to frightfull and
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:170451:53"/>trembling ſhrieks. Ah! Sir Knight, ſaid ſhe to me, We are loſt. And why, ſaid I? <hi>Argoſthenia</hi> would have anſwered, but what through fear, &amp; what through anger, ſhe could not pronounce a word. The behaviour of the Damſel put the people into a ſuſpition, ſo that they deſcended towards us: but on the other ſide ſhe was, by watching, and by travail, and by the things that bound her head ſo transformed, that it would have been no eaſie matter to know her. By this time ſhe knew this to be the Juriſdiction of <hi>Diambres,</hi> which removing thither to effect her rape, had juſt at that inſtant received advice of her taking, and of her flight (with the death of his aſſaſſins) by a Wood-man, which paſsing through the Forreſt at midnight, to provide ſome Wood for his occaſions, had found one of them, yet-half-living upon the ground. He ſuddenly hereupon took horſe with his people, intending to paſſe over into the Forreſt, and cauſe the dead bodies to be buried, that his attempt might not come to light: ſince the fact being committed in the Territories of <hi>Arnaldo,</hi> a Knight of the bloud Royal (beſides his fear of that Cavalier, which would defend his right with Arms) he might thereupon come to be accuſed as guilty of High-Treaſon in the bloud of the Princeſſe. Diſcovering me therefore, together with her; he preſently imagined the truth, for we being fled we knew not whither, were taken in the Net we ſought to avoid. Hereupon he commanded his ſervants ſuddenly to ſurround us and take us; I ſeeing the enterpriſing of an eſcape to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperate, being alone, wounded, and unprovided
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:170451:54"/>againſt a hundred perſons, and being unwilling to forſake the young Lady: onely ſaid to her, that ſhe ſhould not fear, but diſſemble that ſhe knew any thing that he had been the contriver of her raviſhment; and meet the misfortunes of that impriſonment with a ſmiling face. <hi>Diambres</hi> knowing the Lady though thus diſguiſed, was tranſported with an inconceivable joy; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding his Steward to execute what was to be done in the Forreſt: and he returned himſelf into the Caſtle, and cauſed us both to be put in Chambers apart, but yet neer to one another, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming firſt to examine me to know who I was, and whence I came, and what intereſt I had in <hi>Argoſthenia.</hi> I replied with an unmoved coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, telling him the truth of my condition, and as to the Lady, I ſaid, I held no other rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to her perſon then what the duty of a Knight exacted of ſuccouring her, finding her purſued by two aſſaſsins to abuſe her, as I paſt through the neighbouring Forreſt towards <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bes. Diambres</hi> reſted ſatisfied with my freedom, nor would he take notice of the villains, for fear of diſcovering himſelf, but left me with a doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full brow, going to <hi>Argoſthenia;</hi> whereupon per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving already that there was but a Wall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween us, I ſet my eyes and ears on work, to find out ſome crevice, whereat to hear that which paſt about <hi>Argoſthenia.</hi> And fortune was pleaſed ſo ſuccesfully to aſsiſt me, that I found under the Tapeſtry that the Wall was cleft, for that there had been a door which was now made up: I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan with a Rowel of a Spur to ſcrat away the Lime, to make a hole. Which done, I found that
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:170451:54"/>the careleſneſſe of the work-men in ſtopping up that door, had thrown in ſome bits of ſtones, and rubbiſh, covering them over with onely one layer of bricks. I was at this tranſported with joy, and ſeemed to leap into Heaven, promiſing my ſelf now a correſpondency with the young Lady, and to obſerve all the proceedings of <hi>Diambres.</hi> Yet notwithſtanding, I could not for that time, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out making my ſelf heard, learn the leaſt intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of his treaty with her; but in the ſilence of the enſuing night, I opened a breach by the remove of 2 ſtones amongſt the reſt of that rub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſh, and called <hi>Argoſthenia</hi> to me; who told me very good news, that <hi>Diambres,</hi> though other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe rude and beſtial, being civilized and inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted by Love, and, as he ſaid, by my Modeſty and Generoſity, had behaved himſelf in very civil manner towards her, hoping to reduce her by courteſie to admit him for her husband. Yet he had conceived a great jealouſie of me, for having obſerved on her finger the Ring of <hi>Arnaldo,</hi> he feared that there had paſſed ſome kind of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract between us. I comforted, and counſelled the Lady according to that, which I judged op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portune to her preſent condition, and ſo left her with a mind, full of tranquillity, to take her repoſe, for whoſe conſideration more than for any other reaſon, I then became exceeding pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive.</p>

            <head type="sub">Book V.</head>
            <p>THe morning enſuing my departure, news ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived to the ear of <hi>Arnaldo,</hi> that <hi>Argoſthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia</hi> was loſt, and that the Cavalier his Gueſt could not be found in any place, whereupon he diſpatcht all his ſervants to ſeek for them through all the Forreſt. Who having in vain all that day traverſed thoſe Labyrinths, could learn no other tidings of them, than that they had found upon the place where fell out the bloudy Conflict, the Mantle and Bow of the Lady, the earth ſtained with bloud, and the graſſe ſo tram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled round about the place, that it was an eaſie matter to ſuſpect, there had hapned ſome hot en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter of perſons that had ſharply contended for her ſake. The Knight was at this relation ſeiſed with a ſtrange ſhivering; and though the night began to approach, he took with him his Arms, and four men appointed in Garbs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween courtly and martial, to go himſelf out of the Forreſt to trace out farther intelligence of thoſe things, which were reported to him by his domeſticks.</p>
            <p>Getting therefore out of the Forreſt at the time when night began, taking advantage by the Sun's abſence to uſurp upon the dayes ſerenity, he came to underſtand upon paſſing the River, that which the Fiſher-men had related to divers
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:170451:55"/>perſons, how that they had about break of day, ferryed over to the other ſhore, a ſtrange Gentleman with a young Lady in his arms. He hereupon went in perſon to that place, and finding the fiſhermen, he ſtrictly examined them, demanding of them the marks of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons: And perceived they could be no other then <hi>Argoſthenia</hi> and <hi>Philiterus.</hi> The Knight remained at this intelligence very ſad; nor did he know what to think of me; for <hi>Argoſthenia</hi> being in my arms, put ſtrange apprehenſions of ſuſpition in his head of ſome default, whereas in all reaſon, it was moſt probable, that either I was retired with her to the houſe of <hi>Olympia,</hi> or gone away from him without her. On the other ſide, underſtanding that we were both wounded, he comforted himſelf, how that yet we could not be very far off.</p>
            <p>Next being informed, that we were gone towards the Caſtle of <hi>Diambres,</hi> and that many of the people of the place were that day ſeen to go into the Forreſt, fording and refording of the Brook; he imagined the very truth touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that Knight. And reſolving in his mind to be revenged, he went about midnight towards the Caſtle, to obſerve the actions of th'inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants, and gather ſomething whereby to ſatisfy his ſuſpition. The Pallace of that Knight was founded above the wall of the Caſtle, with four Towers, in one of which that did jet out over the Mote, that was but narrow and dry, <hi>Argo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſthenia</hi> and I were confined. But I, that in thoſe finiſter incounters had paſſed two nights with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſleep, was then buryed in a profound ſlum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber;
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:170451:56"/>whereas <hi>Argoſthenia,</hi> kept awake by her amarous cares, heardſome little noyſe of horſes and men, which ſurrounded the outſide of the Caſtle-ditch. Thereupon, raviſhed either by cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity, or by the impetuoſity of a Lover's Soul, which felt it ſelf neer it's proper ſeat; ſhe ran to the window, and though the night wanted the light of the Moon and moſt of the Stars, as being overcaſt with gloomy clouds; yet ſhe thought ſhe knew <hi>Arnaldo,</hi> by his mourning habit. But behold, juſt as ſhe was ready to cry out, to let him know of her being there, <hi>Diambres</hi> entered into her Chamber, onely with one woman, which lighted him; whereupon, ſhe being called that way by the noiſe, and by the light, ſhe became the moſt aſhamed Lady in the world: becauſe covered onely by a pure fine ſmock, ſhe diſcovered from head to foot the delicate proportions of her moſt beautifull bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. <hi>Diambres</hi> beholding, in that her confuſion, the goodlieſt piece that ever Nature framed, he forgot his honeſt purpoſes, and already breathed with thoughts of the pleaſures of Love: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon demanding, not knowing what he ſaid, What ſhe did at that hour at the window; ſhe obſerving by the dejected neſſe of his looks, and by the ſighs he ſent forth, his intentions, coura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giouſly replyed, I looked on my husband, Where? ſaid <hi>Diambres.</hi> Where he was, ſaid <hi>Argoſthenia.</hi> And, Who is he? added <hi>Diambres.</hi> One, ſaid <hi>Argoſthenia,</hi> that can make thee trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble from head to foot; and when he ſhall know where I am, and the wrongs thou doſt me, he will make thee and this Caſtle fly into the air as a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:170451:56"/>to his revenge. Is this thy husband that ſleeps ſo neer thee (ſaid <hi>Diambres</hi> with a diſdain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ſmile) haply a Monarch of ſome vaſt Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire? This is not my ſpouſe, (ſubjoyned <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goſthenia</hi>) he is my brother by honour and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune. Shall <hi>Mars</hi> or <hi>Mercury</hi> then be thy huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band (replyed <hi>Diambres</hi>) that you ſtand at this time of night looking on the Stars in Heaven? Be he who he will (ſaid <hi>Argoſthenia,</hi>) know, that if you, forgetting the duty of a Knight, ſhould uſe any violence to me, my ſpouſe will revenge me of you, to the laſt drop of your blood. And therefore leave me in peace, for theſe are not hours ſeaſonable to be in a maiden's chamber. <hi>Diambres</hi> knew not how to behave himſelf, now hurryed on by his luſt, now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by his duty; ſo that for fear of ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times one thing, ſometimes another, he could not reſolve on any thing, believing that the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy ſpoke in that manner, not becauſe ſhe was really eſpouſed, but in a womaniſh flouriſh; and that if ſo be ſhe were marryed, that fortune could befall none but me. Here his ſenſuall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite being overcome by the incounter of ſuch beaut yes, he laid hands on the innocent Lady, whereupon ſhe, provoked by a rage full of real generoſity, ſuddenly ſnatcht the Candleſtick out of the womans hand, and flung it in the face of <hi>Diambres,</hi> with ſuch a force, that it made him ſtagger, and thus being freed from his hands ſhe flew out of the chamber, and ran wandering up and down the houſe, till ſhe find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a hollow place under a ſtaire-caſe, leapt in, and there conceal'd her ſelf, to expect with the
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:170451:57"/>day ſome opportunity of fortune, either to eſcape, or at leaſt to dye with a boldneſſe wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of her birth and courage. But <hi>Diambres</hi> finding himſelf in ſo ill a plight, and not da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring for ſhame to cry out, returned to his own chamber to have his wound ſearched, giving or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, that without his expreſſe command none ſhould open the gate of his Palace, or of the Caſtle.</p>
            <p>The morning following, there was a very ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curate ſearch made in every place, but <hi>Argo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſthenia</hi> could not be found: which ſo diſpleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Diambres,</hi> that blaſpheming, he threatened to reduce that houſe to aſhes, to burn her in it, being moſt aſſuredly confident, that ſhe could not be gone from thence. The night being come, at the time when all were buryed in ſilence, <hi>Argoſthenia</hi> came forth of her concealment, returning upon her own accord to her priſon, and ſhutting her ſelf in, ſhe came to call me. I having paſt that day among a thouſand perplex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thoughts of her loſſe, ran to hear her, and underſtood what had befaln her; but whilſt I ſtood muſing of ſome plot, to ſave her from eminent ruine, and all in vain: She ſaid to me, Sir, confiding in your faithfulneſſe; I will ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely tell you what I think. If you ſhall like it, well: if not, I am prepared to dye, as I have lived, nobly. I deſire you would ſtudy to open a hole ſo big in this wall, that I may get through into your priſon. The meat they bring you, will ſuffice us both; and for your bed, I will content my ſelf with a ſmall corner at your feet. As for the reſt, I will aſſure my ſelf of
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:170451:57"/>your ingenuity, that you will treate me as the ſpouſe of <hi>Arnaldo,</hi> and your ſiſter. In the mean time, who knows, but that <hi>Arnaldo</hi> may have ſome hint of our impriſonment. I having ſeen him laſt night to ſurround this Caſtle? Which if it be ſo, reſt aſſured that he will not be want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in his duty to his Spouſe, and to a Cavalier to whom he is ſo much obliged. When I ſaw there was no other way for her ſafety, but this, I ſighing, ſaid, She ſhould be obeyed, putting my ſelf alſo in perill of death for her ſafty: for as to the preſerving her ſecret and honeſt, I knew well enough what I was to do. This ſaid, I ſtrove to break the wall without making a noiſe, which I eaſily did: this done, and ſhe having on her ſide gathered all the rubbiſh of that breach, ſhe crept thorough into my cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber; where being entered and got upon her feet, ſhe threw her arms about my neck, and weeping, ſaid, Dear Brother, If I ſhould dye for you a thouſand times, I could not pay the thouſandth part of the obligements I owe you. I innocent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly kiſt her forehead, intreating her to favour me with the continuance of the ſame exceſſive con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence, for the regard of her own and my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. I already know, ſaid ſhe, both who you are, and what I do: Speak no more of it; nor trouble me; for I know you would ſooner dye than fail in your fidelity to <hi>Arnaldo,</hi> or in your reſpects to <hi>Argoſthenia.</hi> Here ending our diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe; we made up that breach in the wall the beſt we could, and tempering the lime in water, ſo daubed up thoſe bricks on my part, that the fraud was very hard to be diſcovered. Which
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:170451:58"/>done becauſe the Lady was half dead with fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, and I was ſlightly ſerved by reaſon of my wounds, ſhe was conſtrained for that time to content herſelf with a few ſlices of Cytron and a little water. By which being reaſonably re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhed, ſhe lay down to ſleep with a wonderfull Modeſty and honeſty on one ſide of the bed, and ſeeing me about to reſt my ſelf on the contrary part, ſhe would by no means permit me to do it, proteſting to me, that if I did, ſhe would perpetually ſtand upon her feer. Hereupon, not to contend with her, I alſo took a part of the bed; confining my ſelf between the bounds of modeſty and honour, not ſo much as to look towards that fide which ſhe had made choice of for her repoſe.</p>
            <p>We paſt away eight dayes in this manner, with much felicity; for <hi>Diambres</hi> neceſſitated by his wound, not onely to keep himſelf reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red but alſo free from the air there reſorted none to my chamber, but onely a Page at the hours of dinner and ſupper, and a Chirurgion once a day. In which time, which I ordered to be very ſhort, <hi>Argoſthenia</hi> lay hid in a cheſt, or under the bed. Withall, I had ſo wholly indeared the Page, a boy of fifteen years, of good extracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, of a facetious Genius, and great Soul, that he uſed me with all the civility that I could de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire. He delighted above meaſure to hear me relate the ſingularities of ſtrange places, and had an ardent deſire to travel for ſome time into <hi>Italy;</hi> And becauſe I on the other ſide extolled, for merit, not for adulation, his Compoſures in Verſe and Proſe, he could have been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent,
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:170451:58"/>to have been continually talking with me. But I excuſed my ſelf by the neceſſity of reſt, to which I pretended my wounds obliged me, and I kept him, for <hi>Argoſthenia</hi>'s conſideration, at the greateſt diſtance I could. I omitted not nevertheleſs for thoſe few moments, which he ſtaid with me, to ask him of the news of the place, and came to know, that (I could not tell how) news was carryed to <hi>Arnalod</hi>'s ear, that the Lady he ſought, could no-where be found, he not being able to learn the Tyranny of <hi>Diam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bres,</hi> and that he accuſed me of her rape; and was gone to <hi>Athens;</hi> whither <hi>Diambres</hi> to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver his own villany had cauſed it to be given out, that I was gone. This blow of injurious calumny, ſtriking at my faithfulneſſe, and the honour of <hi>Argoſthenia,</hi> transfixed my Soul with great anxiety; whereupon to clear my inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, and comfort <hi>Arnaldo</hi> with the poſſeſſion of his Miſtreſſe, I reſolved to beſtir my wit, to free me from that in juſt and wretched capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>y. I began, in order thereunto, to under-feel the Page, if when <hi>Diambres</hi> ſhould reſtore me to liberty, he would accept of my company to tranſport himſelf into <hi>Italy.</hi> I would it would pleaſe Heaven, replyed he, I might be ſo happy. And were it ſo (ſubjoyn'd I) that <hi>Diambres</hi> for his own intereſts, would not free me from this miſery, would you find in your heart to ſee me alwayes thus unhappy? <hi>Euriſthus</hi> ſighed, and ſaid; When there may be found any way, that without prejudice to my reputation, I may leave this ſervice, there ſhould not be that thing in the World, which I would not do for you.
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:170451:59"/>I will content my ſelf with little enough (an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered I) and I will ſo diſpoſe of things, that you ſhall not onely depart with a <hi>Salvo</hi> to your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, but alſo with a conſiderable augmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation in your honour and fortune. And to omit, that the being inſtrumentall in deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an innocent Cavalier, unjuſtly oppreſſed by a barbarous Tyranny, might acquire you the commendation of a more than vulgar generoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; I am able to participate to you the glory of an act, of ſuch a grandure, that you your ſelf will confeſſe your incapacity of ſuch a felicity. But, becauſe I love not to uſe many words, where works of valour and fidelity are expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, reſolve with your ſelf to be my compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, in a grand Enterprize, which though it ſhould ſucceed unhappily, will have you heir of an immortall renown; and then let us con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult of the manner to effect it. Sir, ſaid <hi>Euri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſthus,</hi> I am at your devotion, Command and you ſhall be obeyed. Than ſaid I, it would be neceſſary you provide me ſome deaf files, to file the barrs of a window, and ſilk enough to make a ladder, to reach to the Mote of the Caſtle: ſtick not at the coſt, for I can re pay you to your full ſatisfaction. Here the youth re-joyn'd, Sir, My condition of a Page in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mans houſe, permits me little ability of ſerving you, according to the generoſity of my ſpirit, receiving ſo poor a ſtipend from my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and Maſter, that it hardly ſufficeth to buy me clothes. I will receive therefore what you pleaſe to conſign me, with aſſurance of a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full disburſment. What need more words?
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:170451:59"/>Before three dayes paſt, with the help of <hi>Euri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſthus,</hi> and of our coin, we were furniſhed with tools, and ſilk, ſufficient for our deſign. The files we ſawed the grates with, and, of the ſilk, by the help of <hi>Argoſthenia,</hi> we compoſed the ladder for our eſcape; <hi>Euriſthus</hi> I inſtructed to go forth of the Caſtle, without any alteration in his deportment, and to expect me about mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night on the bank of the Mote. Which he moſt punctually obeyed. And ſeeing, that although the gates were ſhut, yet there was neither guard no centinel in that Caſtle; when about the fourth hour of the night, we heard the ſignal of his arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val, we abſolutely removed the bars of the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow. Then faſtning the ladder to a hook, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructing <hi>Euriſthus</hi> in holding of it ſtedfaſt to the earth: <hi>Argoſthenia</hi> was the firſt which deſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, howbeit ſhe courteouſly conteſted with me, to have had me gone down firſt. She ſuccesful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſcended to the middle of the ladder; but lighting there upon a beam, accidentally jetting out from a window, ſhe ſo intangled her perſon and garments, that ſhe could not poſſibly go up nor down. Seeing ſo unlooked-for a dyſaſter, I was almoſt in diſpair of ſaving her; for if there ſhould any rumour be raiſed in that part, ſhe could not have been able to eſcape in ſuch a conjuncture, from a ſecond and more grievous captivity, to the indangering of her life: To call and inſtruct <hi>Euriſthus</hi> how to aſſiſt her, I might not, for fear of being over-heard. Where upon, I reſolved to venture my ſelf, to relieve her. So that tying my Arms, which <hi>Euriſthus</hi> had privately conveyed into my chamber, to a
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:170451:60"/>long ſtring of ſilk, I let them down to the ground, to be ready at hand, upon any occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; then I nimbly made another rope of the ſheets, towell, and any other thing that came to hand, and faſtned it to the bars of the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, yet remaining, letting my ſelf down; ſtopping at one knot after other, till I came at <hi>Argoſthenia,</hi> now more dead then living, with grief and fear; and diſ-intangled her, cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and looſing her garments and hair from thoſe impediments; and accompanyed and ſuſtained her, till ſhe got to the bottom. Whither be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing come, and having put on my Armes, we im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced in a moſt endearing manner, for mutuall joy of each other's eſcape; and rendering <hi>Euri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſthus</hi> the merited applauds of his Fidelity, we made by large paces towards the Forreſt; for though it were our intent, to take the way to <hi>Athens,</hi> yet, on the contrary, conſidering the faintneſſe of <hi>Argoſthenia,</hi> and how that when our eſcape was known, we ſhould be infallibly purſued, in danger of being overtaken; we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to ſecure our ſelves in the intricate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Forreſt's Labyrinths, and to go from thence ſtreight to the houſe of <hi>Arnaldo,</hi> as well to know ſome thing of his perſon, as alſo to provide our ſelves with Horſes; for I had a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular deſire to recover mine, which I intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not to leave at any rate in thoſe woods, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving travelled with him above ſix hundred miles. It was our fortune, that the Brook, through the dryneſſe of the ſeaſon, was very ſhallow, and that <hi>Euriſthus,</hi> by long practice, was acquainted with the eaſieſt and ſecureſt
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:170451:60"/>fords. <hi>Euriſthus</hi> went through bare-foot firſt, and I followed him, bearing that dear and ſweet bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then, the beautifull <hi>Argoſthenia</hi> in my armes. When we arrived on the other ſide, <hi>Euriſthus</hi> was raviſhed to ſee the maid I carried to be <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goſthenia,</hi> I having told him at the firſt breaking of the buſineſs to him, that ſhe was a young laſs of the Caſtle, that taken with my perſon, had deſired to follow me in that eſcape: And deſiring to ſay very much, he could ſpeak juſt nothing through the ſtupefaction the ſtrangeneſs of that adventure had reduced him to. So travelling gently, becauſe we were unwilling to engage our ſelves by night in Valleys inhabited by Wolves, we approached by break of day to the melancholly Manſion of <hi>Arnaldo,</hi> which now by the departure of its Lord was become the fit ſeat of a Forreſt; there not being left behind of ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny people, more than the Prieſt that officiated in the Temple, and thoſe inferiour ſervants which ordered the <hi>Orchards,</hi> and dreſt the Stables un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſuperviſion of a Bayliffe. Here I found it confirmed that <hi>Arnaldo,</hi> deceived in the falſe report of my flight, was gone to <hi>Athens</hi> to ſeek me: therefore I deſired onely thus much, that they would furniſh us with neceſsaries for that voyage, and to diſpatch news to <hi>Olympia</hi> of our deliverance, with an account of the accidents befaln us with <hi>Diambres.</hi> I deſired that <hi>Argo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſthenia</hi> for her greater decency, and convenience, would take along with her ſome grave woman; but ſhe would not agree to it, ſaying; that for the matter of her own perſon ſhe alone ſufficed, for other things the diligence, and aſſiduity of
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:170451:61"/>
               <hi>Euriſthus</hi> was more then enough; for indeed he ſerved her with profound affection, celerity, promptneſs, and reverence. So making <hi>Euriſthus</hi> to Arm himſelf, and taking a good Guide, we tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed ſuccesfully by ſmall journeys towards <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens,</hi> till ſuch time as coming to the Bank of the River <hi>Aſopos,</hi> we met with an unlucky ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident prepared us by malicious fortune.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Diambres</hi> being informed of my flight, and that of <hi>Euriſthus,</hi> and, which ſeemed yet more ſtrange, of <hi>Argoſthenia</hi>'s, who by the marks left be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind, was known to have been the Gueſt of my priſon; he determined to be revenged at any rate, not ſo much for any impulſe of hatred and paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, as for ſelf-intereſt, to the end we ſhould not divulge the exceſſes of his barbarous incivili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; with repreſenting them moreover to the King of <hi>Thebes,</hi> to the extream endangering of his Exile, and the confiſcation of his goods. Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding therefore, either by conjecture, or report that we had taken our way towards <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens,</hi> and confident, that in reſpect of the deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy of <hi>Argoſthenia,</hi> which he preſumed to be my conſort, we would go but ſlowly, he conceited he might overtake, and retake us unexpectedly in the confines of the Dominion of <hi>Attica.</hi> He ſelected for this purpoſe eight, or ten, of his braveſt ſervants and ſwaſhes; and went (not as yet healed of the blow on his face) with all poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible velocity to that place; and had (for his, and our misfortune) chance ſo propitious to him, that he came upon us when we leaſt expected. In the place, where we came to ferry over it, the ſtream was exceeding large with many whirle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pits,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:170451:61"/>and ſhelves very dangerous to the Paſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, ſo that there was no paſſing from one ſide to another, but onely with a little Boat that was there, ſcarce capable of a man and a horſe. Seeing this neceſſity, for to make way for the others, I entred firſt with my horſe. I would have had <hi>Argoſthenia</hi> to have been wafted over with me, inſtead of my horſe, but the Ferry-man would not permit it, affi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ming that it was a dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous thing to paſſe over horſes without the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtody of their maſters. I went over therefore alone, and the Wherry was returned to fetch the young Lady and her Palfry; but ſhe was ſcarce come to the middle of the River, when, behold <hi>Diambres,</hi> with his face, and thoſe of his follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers covered, arrived upon the ſame ſhoar: and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a ſight of that which he went in ſearch of, he cried to the Boat-man, that upon pain of death he ſhould return back with the charge he conducted. <hi>Euriſthus,</hi> by his voice &amp; deportment knowing his maſter, being all this while on foot, and by that means unobſerved, leapt into the water to ſwim: and I alſo perceiving that the Ferry-man amuſed with the menaces of <hi>Diam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bres,</hi> turned the Veſſel to make towards him, prickt forward my horſe into the River to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pede his intention; and <hi>Argoſthenia</hi> on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide, preſented a Dagger to his breaſt, threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning him with death, if he did not perform the work he had begun of wafting her over: In the ſame inſtant <hi>Euriſthus</hi> alſo got up to the Boat, and attempting to leap into it, he had almoſt like to have ſubmerged it with his weight. But it being held to rights by the Art of the Steerſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man;
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:170451:62"/>I came to graple with him, and drawing my ſword, forced him to direct the Boat not to the ſhoar, but along the ſtream of the River, letting it drive at the pleaſure of the current, till it came to touch at an Iſlet, which I had diſcovered, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant about half a mile, where I promiſed my ſelf ſecure refuge. He obeyed, notwithſtanding the cries and proteſts of <hi>Diambres;</hi> and I perceiving my horſe began to want ground under his feet, ſpurd him back to ſhoar, giving firſt to <hi>Euriſthus</hi> the end of a ſtring that I had about me, that the Ferry-man ſhould not deceive me, by turning as I ſtood on land the Veſſel to another part.</p>
            <p>Thus we walked about three hundred paces, being followed on the oppoſite Bank by <hi>Diam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bres.</hi> I had a thought, that the Bark ſhould take the right arm of the Channel, which was very broad in that place, to the end <hi>Argoſthenia,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended and hid by the Iſle, might land with ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity, and free her ſelf from the eminent peril, without <hi>Diambres</hi> his being able to purſue us in our journey; but the young Lady ſpying by chance a youth behind me, that carried a bow and quiver like a huntſ-man, ſhe began to call out: To land, to land! Stay the boy, ſtay the boy! I obeyed her, and ſtopt him, making him to ſtay with me; and the Water-man, againſt his will, brought his Boat to ſhoar. Here the fair <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goſthenia</hi> came out of the Boat, and with the help of <hi>Euriſthus</hi> (becauſe he would not lend her them) took the bow and quiver from the youth, and looking pleaſantly upon me with a ſmiling aſpect, ſaid: Dear friend, the River is ſo broad in this place, that ſcarce diſcovering my enemy,
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:170451:62"/>I cannot ſhoot at any certainty: yet I will try my fortune. I, interrupting her, ſaid: I beſeech you Madam, be pleaſed not to tempt blind for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune with any advantage; Content your ſelf, you are ſafe, and that before our enemies can get their paſſage over, we ſhall be in a place where they cannot hurt us, the confines of <hi>Attica</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hard by: That we may do: however, ſaid ſhe, give me leave to let fly one Arrow. I told her, ſhe might do as ſhe pleaſed: and ſhe preſently drew the Bow to ſhoot. When juſt at the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant we were diverted with a neerer danger, by the appearance of a Knight which came out of a Track, made dark by the umbrage of Trees, and leading to the River ſide: he was attended by two other perſons on horſ-back; which diſcovering us buſied in that confuſion, ran upon me with his ſword drawn, crying, Ah, Traitor! It was the goodneſſe of heaven, that the horſe I rode on ſhould hear that noyſe, and that voyce; ſo that I leapt aſide that I might avoid that blow, which threatned me with death, <hi>Argoſthenia</hi> hereat loſt not a with of time, but let fly at my unknown enemy the Dart prepared for <hi>Diambres:</hi> yet the confuſion and haſte with which ſhe ſhot it, made her miſſe the mark, and inſtead of the Knight, to hit his horſe in the head over the left eye; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, what by the ſmart, and what by the fright, he was put into ſuch a fury, that running his crupper againſt a Tree he tumbled himſelf, and the Knight into a Ditch, which ſeparated the road from the fields.</p>
            <p>His Companions precipitouſly leapt from their horſes to help him, amongſt whom I diſcovered
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:170451:63"/>the face of <hi>Cadmus,</hi> Page to <hi>Arnaldo,</hi> and by him gueſſing that the faln Knight muſt needs be his maſter, (which by means of his gray Cloaths, and his concealed face half-hid with his Murrion, was wholly unknowable at the firſt ſight) I a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted alſo to his aſſiſtance. <hi>Argoſthenia</hi> cried, Kill the Traitour; but I, that was of an opinion very different from that of hers, ſeeing him bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried in mire, in danger of a ſpeedy ſurrender of his life; aſſured his ſervants that I came to help, not kill him, and putting our ſelves upon an attempt to draw him out of that miſery, we did effect it; but he was ſo bruiſed, and in ſo bad plight, that he ſcarce knew in what part of the World he was.</p>
            <p>I was at this ſpectacle ſo moved with lively reſentments, of Pity, Grief, and Love, that I could not hinder the eſcape of ſome tears through my eyes.</p>
            <p>But, who can aptly deſcribe the ſorrow of <hi>Argoſthenia,</hi> now that ſhe knew her eſpouſed husband, and ſaw him in ſo deplorable eſtate, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſo cruel an attempt upon my perſon, and a hazard of his being ſlain by her own hand: She knew (and perceived by my looks) that he had been deceived, whereupon flinging her ſelf upon him, and with tears imbracing him, ſhe ſaid. Oh! unfortunate Knight; what Devil hath bereft you of judgement, that you go about to kill him, to whom you are obliged for your life, ſafety, and honour? Do you thus pay your ingagements to this Gentleman? Wretched <hi>Arnaldo,</hi> miſerable, even in your felicicy. The Cavalier, more dead then alive by ſo grevious a fall, knew not what to ſay, ſeeing <hi>Argoſthenia</hi> upon him, and me ſo
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:170451:63"/>near in a poſture, that without words did accuſe him of his crime, committed through too preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitate pieviſhneſſe, and ſuperfluous jealouſie. The firſt words that he could diſtinctly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce, was to diſſwade <hi>Argoſthenia</hi> from ſo o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen demonſtrations of her affection: afterwards re-aſſuming by little and little his infeebled for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, (though he had his body miſerably macera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted) he ſtrove to get upon his feet, to walk to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the houſes of the Iſland, where there was a retirement deſtin'd to the uſe of Travellers: but when I acquainted him with the peril he ran into of meeting with <hi>Diambres,</hi> the occaſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of all thoſe miſadventures which we now ſuffered; he boil'd with ſuch reſentments of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation and fury, that almoſt forgetting his pain he ſaid: With-draw <hi>Argoſthenia</hi> a little, that I may in this river waſh off the ſmears of the dirt, and change my Cloaths, and then we will reſolve upon the courſe we ſhall ſteer in our voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age.</p>
            <p>We did ſo; And it chanced that the water was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry warm, for that the Sun had but juſt then began to decline its Meridian; ſo that he found ſome eaſe of the ſmart, which the fall had ſtrangely cauſed in the nervous part of his hips. Refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and re-apparelling himſelf, he would have begg'd a needleſſe pardon for his miſtakes of me, and a brief Narrative of all our adventures. But expecting every minute <hi>Diambres</hi> at our backs, I called him back to other apprehenſions, telling him; That but for the thoughts of <hi>Argoſthenia</hi>'s preſervation, which for that time was more op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portune, I would give my advice, to go (not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:170451:64"/>the diſequality of number and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantages of ſtrength) to meet <hi>Diambres,</hi> and chaſtiſe him for his barbarous Tyranny: but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I will not put it to the hazard of leaving her alone in an unknown Countrey, at the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion of ſickle Fortune; it behoves us with the froſt of prudence to allay the ardor of gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſity, and betake our ſelves to counſels more cautelous than couragious. Therefore let him di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert, though not for ever avert, his merited chaſtiſement. As neer as I can judge, he is not now far off, and perhaps by this time is landed in the Iſland, and ready to recover this ſhore: now if we on the contrary go over to the other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, ſwimming upon our horſes (ſince the Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry-man is ſtipt away) we ſhall diſappoint his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence with a journey contrary to his expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by turning towards <hi>Thebes.</hi> And ſince you be deſtitute of a horſe, and <hi>Eur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſthus</hi> hath likewiſe abandoned his upon the oppoſite ſide; I will take him up behinde me; and for you and the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy <hi>Argoſthenia,</hi> her horſe may ſerve both. Having ſo reſolved, <hi>Arnaldo</hi> commanded <hi>Cadmus</hi> to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to ford the River in the ſafeſt place.</p>
            <p>The couragious Youth ſpur'd his horſe into the water, and having gone a little way with great eaſe, he began to feel no bottom; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon leaving him to ſwim, yet guided by Bitt and Spur, that he might not make a ſtop in the water, he immediately began to ſet foot on land, and ſuccesfully attained the other Bank. <hi>Arnal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do</hi> did nor like that ford, fearing that either his beaſt, or mine, might yield in ſwimming to the labour of ſo great a weight: and on the other ſide
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:170451:64"/>
               <hi>Argoſthenia</hi> cried that we had better, to avoid a certain danger, expoſe our ſelves to an uncertain fortune. And I added: I know what I ſay, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam; <hi>Diambres</hi> will over take us within this half hour. For me, I but meanly priſe the endanger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my life in your ſervice, againſt ſuch inequa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of power and people. But you, what would you do? My horſe hath forded other manner of Rivers then <hi>Aſopos,</hi> and with other manner of weights, then now he is like to carry. I would freely offer him you; but I know that he will not well be rul'd (where I am) by the guidance of any other hand. Sir, ſaid <hi>Euriſthus</hi> take you <hi>Argoſthenia</hi> behind you, and I will ſwim over, for my Cloaths are not yet dry.</p>
            <p>To that <hi>Argoſthenia</hi> would by no means con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, being unwilling ſo much to incommode the generous Youth, to whom his former ſervices ſpoke her ſo much obliged; but <hi>Arnaldo</hi> deſiring her to be adviſed by us, ſhe obeyed. I preſently entred the ſtream, and <hi>Euriſthus</hi> caſt himſelf in after me to ſwim, and after him entred <hi>Arnaldo,</hi> followed by his Squire My horſe ſeemed to ſport with the ſtream, with ſuch volubility did he cut and trample that water under foot; inſomuch that I was almoſt come to the other ſhore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Arnaldo</hi> had ſcarce waded the third part of the way.</p>
            <p>In the mean time the curioſity and love of <hi>Argoſthenia,</hi> made her ever and anon to look back towards the Knight her ſpouſe: thereupon hearing him once, angrily rating his horſe, that peradventure was affrighted by the ſwelling of the Torrent, which imperuouſly aſſaulted him in
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:170451:65"/>the midſt of the ſtream; ſhe turned her ſelf with ſuch haſte, and careleſneſſe towards him, that ſhe ſlipt from her horſe into the water, ſinking to the bottom without any ſtay. Providence, which would not permit her to be the food of that E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lement, had provided her of a help before the danger, by placing <hi>Euriſthus</hi> to ſwim behind us; for he diving preſently after her, drew her out of that dangerous current, as yet half-alive. I alſo at the ſame inſtant feeling bottom, leapt from my horſe to help, and take her, as being far taller, and ſtronger than <hi>Euriſthus,</hi> into my arms, and carried her a-ſhoar. But <hi>Arnaldo</hi> in ſeeing her fall, and knowing himſelf far from relieving her, was ready to throw himſelf for deſperation into the middle of the Torrent to drown himſelf; but co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to land, and ſeeing her in my arms, he was ready to die of jealouſie, renewing his former ſuſpition of our Amorous correſpondence. Yet diſſembling the ſame, he ſtood without giving us a word: nor ſpake I at all to him, though I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived his ſuſpition.</p>
            <p>By this time <hi>Argoſthenia</hi> coming to her ſelf with reverſing all the water her ſtomack was op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed with, ſhe began to ſay to me: Certainly heaven hath ſome wonderfull thing to do in our perſons: Sir, My having received life ſo often from your hands, and the ſeries of dangers, through which I paſſe every moment, makes me think, that either ſome very great good, or great ill, is portended to us by this encounter of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality. I onely calling <hi>Arnaldo</hi> to hearken to what I ſaid, replied; Madam! Heaven is pleaſed ſometimes to work its wonders, not onely un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:170451:65"/>to, but deſpiſed by, the world. It hath deſigned you to a fortune above your hopes. Be pleaſed therefore to condeſcend to take <hi>Arnaldo</hi> for your Spouſe and Husband. Here ſhe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terupted me. Is this a time (ſaid ſhe) for ſuch an affair? Will not my word ſuffice, which I have already paſt to you? No, Madam, ſaid I: but it is requiſite the buſineſſe paſſe farther: Contract your ſelves to each other, and then we will talk with you. This they did, with the aſſiſtance of my ſelf and of <hi>Euriſthus;</hi> and I deſiring to diſcharge my ſelf wholly of the things I was intruſted with by the Lady, preſently pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented the Neck-chain, with her picture to <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naldo;</hi> which ſhe had commanded me to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent him with all. <hi>Arnaldo</hi> earneſtly beholding it, ſaid; Since that this Medall may be divided, you would oblige me, Madam, if you would pleaſe to keep my picture, which is inchaſed therein, and I take yours. And here he related to us, that he had formerly made that necklace to preſent <hi>Lucinda</hi> with: and loſt it upon the very ſame day, the tilting was celebrated at <hi>Thebes.</hi> And I (added <hi>Argoſthenia,</hi>) found it up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Sea-ſhore, at my firſt Landing in the <hi>Boeotian</hi> dominions, and having made the picture of <hi>Lucinda</hi> to be changed for that of mine, I have alwayes worn it in my breaſt, for the Love of <hi>Arnaldo,</hi> till ſuch time as it pleaſeth Heaven, inſtead of his picture, to make me poſſeſſe his perſon. <hi>Arnaldo</hi> therefore took onely her pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture, hanging it in another chain, reſtoring his own to her, to wear it for his ſake. Then I, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terupting this their amorous contention, ſaid;
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:170451:66"/>Sirs: the night is already near at hand, and it's neceſſary we provide ſome lodging where to refreſh you, being both in equall need of it.</p>
            <p>Whilſt I thus ſpoke, I diſcovered a Bark, that ſcouring along thoſe coaſts, ran a ſwift courſe down the ſtream of the River. She had, at a place a little diſtant, diſcharged her marchandize, and was returning to the mouth of the River, for new fraight. There came at that inſtant into my mind, a new conceit, upon which I addreſt my ſelf to them, ſaying; Sirs, (ſaid I) Our intereſts and your deſtiny calls us to <hi>Negropont.</hi> This Bark may waft us over for this little diſtance with ſecurity and commodiouſneſſe: and though yet there were no other benefit to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired hence, this would be no little one, of avoyding the incommodity of a journey by Land, at this time of night, and in this neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity which you have of repaſt, to your bodyes, and repoſe to your wounds. My counſell was approved by the contracted couple: And the Bark was made immediately to ſtay: which we hyred to the River's mouth, with great content to the Marriners, to whom, in regard they were diſcharged of their Lading, and bound to the ſame place, the money ſeemed eaſily got. Being entered therein, and the Lady having ſupt ſlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with ſuch viands, as they gave her, and did provide at a Peaſants cottage, as we paſt by; but yet merrily enough, ſave only that <hi>Arnaldo</hi> was exceedingly troubled at <hi>Argoſthenia</hi>'s relation of the paſſages under the Tyranny of <hi>Diambres:</hi> and I after ſupper imparted to <hi>Argoſthenia,</hi> the
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:170451:66"/>news of <hi>Negropont,</hi> putting her in expectation of things above her hope. The morning fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, leaving <hi>Argoſthenia</hi> with the Pages in the Bark: <hi>Arnaldo</hi> and my ſelf, to enjoy the pleaſure of the fields, would take Horſe, ordering the Pilot ſo to ſteer the Veſſell, that it might be near at hand for us to retire to at our pleaſure.</p>
            <p>Thus we walked about a league, talking and diſcourſing upon the expected adventure, in the revolt of <hi>Calcidonia;</hi> till we came to a little Forreſt of water-Poplers, which were caſually ſprung up on thoſe ſhoars, by reaſon the River, inclining in it's courſe towards the contrary banks, wearing away the earth on that ſide, had left this ſide dry, out of which was grown up this little Wood of Willows and Poplers. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing entred into it, and having gone ſcarce fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty paces, we were preſently ſurrounded by about thirty Ruffians, ſome on foot, and ſome on horſe-back, with their faces masked, one appearing before all the reſt, ſhewing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to be the leader of that rout, who directed a dart at <hi>Arnaldo</hi> to lay him dead on the graſſe: yet the blow failed the Aſſaſſin's expectation; for it paſt between the ſide, and the arm, of the Knight, doing him no other harm, but gliding along his cloths gave a little race to his skin: But <hi>Arnaldo</hi>'s blow, did not in that manner fail him; for preſently laying hand on his ſword, he threw himſelf with ſuch an impetuoſity upon the Aſſaſſin, that running him through and through, he fell dead to the ground. On the otherſide, being unwilling to dye unrevenged, I did what I could; and if the hour of my death
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:170451:67"/>had been by Heaven decreed to have been then, I certainly deſerved it, by what I then did. But what could three perſons alone do againſt thirty Villains? <hi>Arnaldo</hi>'s Squire was ſlain, and he and I were ſo ſorely wounded in many parts of our bodyes, that we fell half dead, and as they thought wholly life-leſſe, upon the ground.</p>
            <p>Yet I, as being leſſe hurt, preſently re-aſſum'd my ſpirits that were fled, and opened my eyes, ſoon again grown ſad by the ſight of ſix dead bodies (for of that number as yet <hi>Arnaldo</hi> appeared:) but ſeeing my horſe cloſe by me, as if he had been condoling me; I gathered thence, that it was not to rob, but to murther us, that they had ſo rudely handled us. Raiſing up my ſelf therefore the beſt I might, and ſearching my wounds, I found my ſelf hurt in the thigh, and the left ſide; in the arm, and right ſhoulder; and in the middle of my belly; of all which wounds, only this laſt ſeemed mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall. I bound it up therefore before the reſt, and would go viſite the dead body of <hi>Arnaldo,</hi> and finding him ſtill breathing, I comforted my ſelf; and, bringing him better to himſelf, he ſlowly and heavily opened his eyes, and ſcarſe knowing me cloſed them up again, as if at that inſtant he had breathed out his Soul. Seeing him in ſo miſerable a condition, I ſtrived to get upon my Horſe, to ſeek out ſome better means for his ſuccour: but in vain. For the Marriners hearing the noiſe of the fight, and ſeeing per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps ſome of the Rogues along the ſhore, had (notwithſtanding the cryes of <hi>Argoſthenia</hi>) with ſails and oars ſo haſtned the voyage, that
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:170451:67"/>they were gone above two leagues from that place in an hour.</p>
            <p>Being unwilling therefore to abandon the Knight in thoſe miſerable extremit yes, I return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into the wood, and found by chance two Peaſants paſſing that way, with intention to rob the dead bodyes, whom (though at my coming they began to run away) I ſo far engaged with my cariage and language, promiſing them a rich reward for that ſervice, that they ſtayed: and underſtanding that they were ſons to two la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring men of thoſe parts, I deſired one of them, which I thought more diſcreet than the other, to goe and call them, to carry that Gentleman into ſome convenient place, where to cure or bury him. The young man ran, encouraged by the reward, and returned expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditiouſly with his father, and a girl, who went for the good-mans daughter; which being ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly come to us, ſhe flung her ſelf upon the face of the Cavalier, and muttered I know not what charms, ſo that he preſently returned again to himſelf. Afterwards ſhe told me, ſhe would ask no more, but onely that ſhe might be permitted to try her ſecrets, to cure that almoſt-dead bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, being oppreſt with ſix mortall wounds. I ſaw ſhe ſpoke with diſcretion, and that the Knight grew worſe every moment, therefore I told her, She ſhould do her pleaſure. So ſhe ſearched his wounds, but would let none ſee how ſhe would cure him; for ſhe would not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of any aſſiſtance; as in like manner ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed all help in dreſſing me, though in a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent manner, having ſuddenly ſecured our lives,
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:170451:68"/>without giving us the leaſt occaſion to learn thoſe ſecets. What ſhall I ſay? In four and twenty hours I beheld <hi>Arnaldo,</hi> whom I had bemoaned as dead, healed: and I, that was like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to live kept my bedd a month, almoſt in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair of recovery. But the Cavalier, though he was extreamly loath to leave me alone in that Village, yet in the end, conſtrained by his duty, and by my intreaties, he went towards the Mouth of the River in ſearch of <hi>Argoſthenia;</hi> and I remained, though ſo ſorely diſeaſed, to enjoy the pleaſing converſation of the young Damſel, my Doctreſſe and Keeper.</p>

            <p>THe Leader of the Aſſaſſins ſlain by the hand of <hi>Arnaldo,</hi> was the Tyrant <hi>Diambres;</hi> who in the paſſage which wee made along the little Iſland, where he had for that night took up his lodging, knew by my Horſe, which with thoſe others of our company, ſtood upon the fore-deck of the Ship, who was his maſter, and learnt ſomething alſo of the arivall and ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes of <hi>Arnaldo;</hi> whilſt we ſtayed to ſup, and whilſt the Marriners were at ſupper (which took up three hours time) he got before us with his attendants, to weave ſome new trechery: ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing that <hi>Arnaldo</hi> would go attended ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>didly, according to his quality. So he gave no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:170451:68"/>to ſome vile people of thoſe parts, that we were exiled from <hi>Thebes,</hi> and were flying to <hi>Negropont:</hi> he moreover incouraged them to ſlay us, to gain a great ſum, which as he affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, was ſet upon our heads. But he being the firſt that was ſlain, in attempting of this exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crable enterpriſe, and after him three of his beſt Souldiers, it occaſioned that the Villains, (ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertiſed by the flight of the other retainers to <hi>Diambres,</hi> that that affair would ſucceed very contrary to what he had told them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>) for our good fortune left us all, ſome alive, ſome dead upon the ground, every one retireing to his own houſe, leſt they ſhould be accuſed of ſuch a murder. <hi>Arnaldo</hi> being healed as I told you, and departed in queſt of his Miſtreſſe, I kept my bed ſtill, under the amorous and dear charge of the fair <hi>Orſina.</hi> And becauſe her garb, her looks, and her vertues, ſpake her to be more then the daughter of a Farmer, I deſired one day to know from her ſuppoſed mother <hi>Serena,</hi> the truth of matters, concerning her; and ſhe with a deportment, ſavoring not a jot of rurall, thus ſpoke to me.</p>
            <p>Sir, Since I ſee that this noble, and virtuous Girl, delighted by your courteous carriage, and by the grace of your countenance and expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, hath conceived an infinite affection for you, and deſires exceedingly to ceaſe this pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorall life, and to go to live in an other place and employment, more conformable to her birth, and inclinations; I will diſcover to you that concerning her, which none elſe knows, except my husband and I; and leave you to do as you ſhall pleaſe.</p>
            <pb n="120" facs="tcp:170451:69"/>
            <p>There went, now ſixteen years agoe, to <hi>Corinth,</hi> upon occaſions of his ſtudyes, an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Gentleman, of great birth, but greater virtue: he put himſelf to lodge, according to the cuſtom of Scholars, in the houſe of a young and come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly woman, a Citizen, which being left a Widow in the flower of her years, with ſome Fortune, in movable goods, had applyed her ſelf to this Calling, very profitable in that City, of boarding <hi>Tranſ-mountanian</hi> and <hi>Tranſ-marine</hi> Scholars, which were wont to become the moſt modeſt, and moſt ſtudious, of all thoſe about our parts; whereas ours commonly abandoned themſelves to all diſſoluteneſſe. Now, as it ſhould happen, theſe two, being both alike young, and fair, they were mutually enamoured of one another; their names were <hi>Roſmond</hi> and <hi>Camilla,</hi> and making uſe of their liberty and familiarity, there was both of them this goodly child <hi>Orſina.</hi> The love of the daughter, no leſſe than that of the mother, detained <hi>Roſmond</hi> at <hi>Corinth</hi> ſome five or ſix years; whence at laſt being neceſſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to depart about urgent affaires, he left about three thouſand Ducates, in aſſignment of Portion to <hi>Orſina,</hi> and pretious gifts moreover and above to her Mother. She notwithſtanding, conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued to lodge Gentlemen of ſuch like quality: &amp; <hi>Orſina</hi> came by that means to learn, not onely foraign Languages, but alſo the Principles of the Sciences, eſpecially Phyſik &amp; Chirurgery: in which profeſſions, ſhe is able to do ſtrange things with onely two or three words, as what ſhe hath experimented in <hi>Arnaldo,</hi> whom ſhe hath raiſed from death to life, may eaſily perſwade you.
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:170451:69"/>It happened in this mean time, that certain con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſts aroſe among the Scholars, her gueſts; which breaking into blows, ſome of them were ſlain at the table, mingling their blood with their victualls and wine. Whereat, <hi>Camilla</hi> being afrighted, and fearing to be cited before the Judges, ſhe packt up all her richeſt movables, with what money ſhe could preſently get toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and imbarkt her ſelf for <hi>Athens:</hi> where not holding her ſelf for all that ſecure enough, ſhe would go into <hi>Negropont,</hi> as being a disjunct Juriſdiction from the Dominion of <hi>Attica,</hi> and ſtayed her voyage in this place, and in the end, dyed in this houſe; firſt leaving, and recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending to my charge, this her daughter, now twelve years of age. I have not been wanting on my part, for the bringing of her up, for this three years, that ſhe hath been here, with the beſt decorum my ruſticity would permit; ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving my ſelf learnt ſome thing in my younger dayes, in the ſervice of a Lady of <hi>Athens,</hi> which in the end marryed me to this Husbandman, with more regard to her convenience, than my ſatisfaction, though I confeſſe my ſelf well enough pleaſed with this manner of life, which though rude and toylſom, is yet ſimple, and quiet. Now <hi>Orſina</hi> having often entreated me to carry her to <hi>Corinth,</hi> to procure for her the Dowry, left her by her Father, and to marry her; I could never prevail with my husband to content her; for having never gone out of the bounds of theſe Villages, he fears the world will fall on his head, if he hear but any ſtrange Country named. If you ſhall pleaſe therefore,
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:170451:70"/>gentle Sir, to favor this maid with your aſſiſtance, &amp; protection, though my husband gainſay it, yet being informed by <hi>Arnaldo</hi> of your noble qual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, I will conſigne to you that little Coyn, and ſuch Jewells as I have left in my hands by her Mother; aſſuring my ſelf, that ſhe cannot but arive ſafely to the end of her deſires. She is already pleaſed with it; and tells me, She would account her ſelf happy, in being able to ſerve you. Do you reſolve therefore, for we are ready to execute what you ſhall command us.</p>
            <p>I was well pleaſed with the converſation and the Virtue of <hi>Orſina,</hi> but the taking ſuch troubles upon my ſelf, was a thing wholly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to my Genius and inclinations: And the buſineſſe of <hi>Argoſthenia,</hi> had made me to know by proof, what I might expect from travelling up and down the world with Women, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly young and handſom. Yet the intreaties of the child being added to the perſwaſions of the woman, and knowing my ſelf obliged to her for my health, I promiſed, that ſo ſoon as I was diſ-engaged from the company of <hi>Arnaldo,</hi> I would conduct her to <hi>Corinth,</hi> to her Parents houſe: and it fell out ſooner than I thought for: For, <hi>Euriſtus</hi> coming to ſee me with Letters from <hi>Arnaldo;</hi> I knew not how to reward him for my liberty, which I obtained by his means, bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than by giving him <hi>Orſina</hi> in marriage, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the notion of my Daughter, with all that depoſited by her Father, as the Inheritance of her Mother, with a conſiderable riſe to his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune.</p>
            <pb n="123" facs="tcp:170451:70"/>
            <p>The advice brought me by <hi>Euriſtus,</hi> was, that <hi>Arnaldo,</hi> having found <hi>Argoſthenia</hi> at the mouth of <hi>Aſopos,</hi> expecting of him, they had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to return together to that Village, to aſſiſt me in my diſtemper, till I was recovered: But having deferred it, by reaſon of <hi>Cadmus</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing indiſpoſed, and withall, to underſtand my pleaſure; I, that already was aware, that <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naldo,</hi> for all his generoſity, languiſhed with a jealouſy of me, and that this reſolution, of coming back, was a motion of <hi>Argoſthenia;</hi> as it was on the other ſide an invention of <hi>Arnaldo,</hi> to remit it to my diſpoſall: and being deſirous withall to ſee my ſelf at liberty, to travell the world according to my purpoſed intent, I imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly diſpatcht back <hi>Euriſthus,</hi> to intreat them both, that they would not incommode them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves for my ſake, but purſue the courſe of their own fortune, and go to <hi>Calcides,</hi> to ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrate with ſolemnity their Nuptialls, by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of the Dutcheſſe, from whoſe pleaſure did depend their felicity, and advancement: For that when I was ridd of my infirmity, I would wait upon them in perſon, at a time, when my urgent affairs would better permit. Yet I ſhould, where-ever I came, and in all conditions, of eſtate, and fortune, ever bear in mind the obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations received from them both, to preſerve them freſh in my memory, to the laſt moment of my life.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Euriſthus</hi> returned with new Letters from <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naldo</hi> and <hi>Argoſthenia,</hi> who by all means deſired me to be at <hi>Calcides,</hi> before the diſcloſing of themſelves, being willing to have me preſent at
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:170451:71"/>the opening of that Scene. But I reſolved to travell to <hi>Corinth,</hi> to ſettle <hi>Euriſthus</hi> and <hi>Orſina,</hi> and free my ſelf from this new ſuggeſtion. And it was the goodneſſe of deſtiny, ſo to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of it; for if new accidents of adverſe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune ſhould croſſe their deſign, I ſhould be alſo inevitably much concernd in it, without any other fruit, but onely that of a miſerable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy of fidelity, and an infortunate amity.</p>
            <p>They therefore hired a Bark, to tranſport them to <hi>Calcides:</hi> and ſcarce had they put out of the Port, but they were taken by a Pinnace of Pirats, belonging to <hi>Rhodes,</hi> who preſently fettered <hi>Arnaldo,</hi> and reſerved <hi>Argoſthenia,</hi> upon ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of her extream beauty, for a mighty ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom; paſſing to unlade their wealthy booty at <hi>Scarpanto;</hi> where they ſold <hi>Arnaldo</hi> (though he promiſed them great ranſoms, and let them know his quality) to a very covetous and chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh Merchant, who notwithſtanding the come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe of his perſon, and the offers made by him of vaſt ſums, ſent him to work in certain Vineyards of his, in a Village in the Country. <hi>Arnaldo</hi> being aſſaulted, but not vanquiſhed by ſo ſtrong guſts of fortune, inured himſelf to this courſe of life, in hope of ſpeedy redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption, having found out a way to diſpatch Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to <hi>Thebes,</hi> letting his friends know his miſery, that ſo he might be ſet at liberty, with force of gold, and the interpoſition of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall power. Yet he was in continuall apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of ſorrow in behalf of the unfortunate <hi>Argoſthenia</hi> his Spouſe, which for her ſingular beauty, might be preſumed ſubject to a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:170451:71"/>accidents of adverſe fortune: verifying in his perſon, but too much, the title which he bore of the <hi>Injur'd Lover.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But from the ſelf-ſame conſideration that trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled him, did ariſe the cauſe of his ſecurity; thoſe barbarous villains, having for their more profit till then preſerved her incontaminated. She yet never ceaſed weeping in that her cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity, wherein ſhe was deprived of all comforts: and were it not that ſhe was loath to wiſh him ſo much unhappineſſe, ſhe could in that calamity have deſired the converſation of <hi>Philiternus.</hi> Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a time, the Pyrats ſet ſayl for <hi>Rhodes,</hi> and there expoſed to ſale that precious merchandize, the admirable <hi>Argoſthenia,</hi> as a thing deſired by many, though but few were found, who durſt buy her at ſo exceſsive a price, as the Pyrates ſet up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on her, which was no leſſe then twenty thouſand Ducats; there being none would venture ſo much money on a Jewel, which, though lovely in extremity, might in an hour, change and loſe all its beauty.</p>
            <p>But that which one alone could not do, three young Gallants together, (to their own ruin) attempted: who being otherwiſe intimate friends, agreed to buy her joyntly, to poſſeſſe her alſo to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether by turns. Fools that they were, not to conſider, <hi>That women were made to part, not to unite the Wills of men:</hi> and, <hi>That the Throne and Bed deteſt competition.</hi> The money being diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burſed, their agreement being for eighteen thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Ducats, they conducted the innocent prize to the houſe of <hi>Antiochus,</hi> the principal of the Purchaſors, where the other two, <hi>Hermogenes</hi>
               <pb n="126" facs="tcp:170451:72"/>and <hi>Arbant</hi> fell into a conteſt with him, Who ſhould enjoy her the firſt night: He treating them with very unworthy terms, ſaid; that all reaſon required, that for nobility and fortune be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their better, the precedency in that Love was his of right. <hi>Arbant,</hi> by this time grown all into a fury, told him, that having equally diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded his money as well as he, he knew not how to yield to him in this matter. <hi>Hermogenes,</hi> of a more tranquill mind, was content to remit the deciſion of it to Lot: but not being hearkned to by the other two, they broke out into ſuch terms of rage, that <hi>Arbant</hi> challenged <hi>Antiochus</hi> out of his houſe, and after an obſtinate Combat <hi>Antio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus</hi> was ſlain, and <hi>Arbant</hi> ſo ill handled, that he did not ſurvive him many dayes. <hi>Hermogenes</hi> as the third buyer, challenged the poſſeſſion of the fair Captive, but he was joyntly denied her by the Heirs of <hi>Antiochus</hi> and <hi>Arbant,</hi> till he had repayed them the ſums contributed by the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>funct parties to that mournfull purchaſe.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Argoſthenia</hi> cut off this contention: for, engaging to her the women of <hi>Antiochus</hi> his houſe, with the diſcovery of her quality and misfortunes, they were moved with ſuch a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion of her calamities, that they helped her to eſcape, being diſguiſed in boy's apparrel; ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving firſt ſomething ſhortned her hair, and diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loured her face.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Argoſthenia</hi> being gone, &amp; the ſtrife at an end, ſhe, who found nothing about her but her Wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Necklace with <hi>Arnaldo</hi>'s Picture, &amp; two, or three pieces of Gold, preſerved from the rapine of the Pirates, which had been ſo modeſt with her, as
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:170451:72"/>not to ſearch, and ranſack her in her under Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; knew not how to get out of that Iſle, and return to her own Countrey, ſo lonely and forlorn as ſhe was, but went wandring up and down the Villages adjacent, as if ſhe begged Alms, fearing leſt if ſhe ſhould ſhew her Gold to any to work her return, ſhe ſhould be either ſtopt, or robb'd. Till in the end lighting upon a poor old woman, but of a hearty conſtitution, which alſo went ranging up and down the Iſle, ſhe conſorted her ſelf with her, taking a reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion at laſt to diſcloſe her ſelf, promiſing any recompence ſhe ſhould ask, if ſhe would aſſiſt her in getting from thence to the Iſles of <hi>Scarpanto,</hi> or <hi>Negropont.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The good old woman was content, and took her in place of her ſon, traveling together to the Weſtern Coaſts, and there finding a Fiſher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boat, of the largeſt ſiſe that furrow the Seas on ſuch imployments; She offered them ten Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cats upon her disimbarking on the Iſle of <hi>Scar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panto.</hi> The Fiſher-men at firſt thought themſelves mocked: but the Damſel aſſuring them that there was thoſe in that Iſle, who would preſently pay them, and conſidering that they were to go to Sea to fiſh, they agreed, and with a proſperous voyage arrived there the ſame night. Here <hi>Argo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſthenia</hi> landed in the morning, leaving the old woman in the Bark for ſecurity, and went to the houſe where <hi>Arnaldo</hi> was ſold. But learning he was gone to his maſters Countrey-houſe to work, ſhe was exceeding glad. And becauſe it was but three miles off, ſhe went thither upon the wings of Love, and of deſire, in a ſhort ſpace;
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:170451:73"/>and ſeeking of him, ſhe was brought to the place with much courteſie by a certain honeſt woman. She found him with his Fetters at his heels, and his Mattock and Spade going to work, and was ſo moved in mind at ſo deplorable a ſpectacle, that not able to keep upon her feet, ſhe ſunk down with ſorrow and regret.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Arnaldo</hi> and the woman ran to help her, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazed with the ſtrangeneſſe of the accident. But their words nothing availing, the woman ran to her houſe to fetch ſome Vinegar, Water, and Wine, and the like, to bring her again to her ſelf; and in the mean time the confuſion of <hi>Arnaldo</hi> much increaſed, thinking he knew the features of that beautiful viſage; howbeit, that her ſhort hair, and Olive-coloured face, and mans apparel, made <hi>Argoſthenia</hi> unknowable. But ſhe returning to her ſelf, and taking an opportunity when the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man was returned with her implements to her houſe, ſhe ſaid to the Knight. <hi>Arnaldo,</hi> a perſon of your acquaintance ſent me to ſalute you from her. Here is a Bark of certain Fiſher-men of <hi>Rhodes,</hi> in which I come to finde you, promiſing them ten Ducats upon my word; if you pleaſe to lend them me, I will leave you a pawn ſhall countervail them a hundred times.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Arnaldo</hi> anſwered, that for money he had none, but yet he would procure ſome by that womans means to ſerve her upon a Chain, which he wore at his breaſt. And I alſo, ſaid <hi>Argoſthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,</hi> have Gold to make money of; and ſo ſaying, drew forth her Necklace: when <hi>Arnaldo</hi> ſaw that, growing pale, he ask't her, Who gave her it? Your ſelf, ſaid ſhe. And is it poſſible that through this
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:170451:73"/>diſguiſe you ſhould not perceive <hi>Argoſthenia? Arnaldo</hi> trembled and ſigh'd with fear and joy at thoſe words, and if he had not perceived the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man returning, he would have imbraced her in his arms. But, diſguiſing the matter, he turned his ſpeech to the woman, and deſired to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure (not on the Necklace, but) upon a Brace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let that <hi>Argoſthenia</hi> gave him, twenty Ducats for that young man to imploy in his ſervice.</p>
            <p>The woman miſtruſting nothing, but thinking to receive ſome benefit to her ſelf, went pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently about it, in which mean time <hi>Argoſthenia</hi> gave <hi>Arnaldo</hi> relation of her adventures, and of her intent to get him thence by one means or an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other; for if he would but return with her in that Fiſher-boat to <hi>Rhodes,</hi> he ſhould be ſure un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der her conduct to find more eaſily ſome way to tranſport themſelves for <hi>Negropont. Arnaldo</hi> wept extreamly to hear her ſtrange fortunes, in being born for the death of ſo many perſons; but in particular as to the getting out of that ſlave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, he could not upon a ſudden contrive a way to effect it; there being no other way to the Haven, but through the Citie: where in the day-time he would be ſtay'd, and in the night he could not get out, in regard he was loaded with Chains. <hi>Argoſthenia</hi> ſigned, and pauſing awhile, ſhe ſaid. When the Weſtern Knight freed me from the thraldom of <hi>Diambres,</hi> we filed aſunder in two hours the Iron-bars of a Window; and, Is there no way to break the Chains that are about your feet? But where ſhall we find (ſaid <hi>Arnaldo</hi>) ſuch a kind of file, in ſo forlorn a place? Think not of that, ſaid <hi>Argoſthenia,</hi> here's that will do
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:170451:74"/>the work: And pulled forth a little flat Glaſſe Vial, about the bigneſſe of a Nut, ſaying. Before the Cavalier cut the bars, he put ſome of this wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter on them, of which he gave me this Cruſe. But in the uſing it, you muſt have a care you touch it not with your finger, leſt its malevolent nature ſhould hurt you. Hereupon <hi>Arnaldo</hi> pulled a little Cotton out of the quilting of his Doublet, and, juſt dipping it in the water, ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed the Lock that fettered his feet, according to the direction of <hi>Argoſthenia,</hi> and he preſently ſaw the admirable effect; for, being made of pure Iron without the help of a file, it flew open; whereas in the grate of <hi>Diambres,</hi> the Iron being Steeled the help of files was alſo requiſite.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Arnaldo</hi> ſeeing himſelf at liberty, My dear Soul (ſaid he) let's not ſtay any longer here, where we can expect no advantage: but let us leave the Bracelet to this woman, in reward of her civilities to me. I am certain ſhe cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn this hour: and by that time ſhe doth come back, the Gates will be ſhut; ſo that we cannot enter without being ſeen. And this buſineſſe likewiſe would be done preſently, in regard all the people of theſe parts are gone into the Mountains to vintage, upon which occaſion not ſo much as the little Children are left at home, it being, at this time of vintage, permitted to every one to eat as much as they pleaſe. And again, we ſhall come to the Citie in an hour, wherein we ſhall be unobſerved, for it will be about nine of the Clock. And afterwards we will follow the counſel of <hi>Philiternus,</hi> who adviſeth that, in all Enterpriſes, <hi>We muſt ſtill give place to
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:170451:74"/>Fortune, who is alwayes a friend of reſolute Souls</hi> Let us go Madam. <hi>Argoſthenia</hi> thought it an Age, till ſhe ſaw her Spouſe freed from that cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity, and therefore would not contradict him, but made uſe of Fortune's favour.</p>
            <p>What need more words? They came by hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py providence ſafe to the Port, the Citie being open, and without Guards in that hour of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirement: But yet there they met with another accident to croſſe them; for <hi>Argoſthenia</hi> having, inſtead of the promiſed money, brought the Fiſher-men a man, in Garb very ſuſpitious, they would take neither of them into the Bark. <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naldo</hi> a good while patiently endured their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinencies; but at laſt, ſeeing there was no other way to perſwade them, he pluckt out an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other Bracelet of <hi>Argoſthenia</hi>'s, and offered it them for ſatisfaction of that their ſervice. Then the Fiſher-men had ſo much the more ſuſpition of his perſon: and were beginning to put off from the ſhoar, being unwilling to receive per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons that were to be ſuſpected, either of Flight, or of Theft. <hi>Arnaldo</hi> by this time, being enraged by neceſſity with an extraordinary paſſion, and not uſual in him, leapt into the Bark, and ſnatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up an Oare, menaced with an auſtere, and terrible look, preſently to diſpatch him that offered to oppoſe him; whereupon not having the courage to defend themſelves, two (of five that they were) leapt, for fear, upon the ſhoar. <hi>Arnaldo</hi> being hereby the better ſecured, took into his cuſtody two Spears, two Bows, and all the Arms and Swords he found; and helping <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goſthenia</hi> aboard, commanded him that ſate at
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:170451:75"/>Stern to turn the Prow towards <hi>Candia,</hi> promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing him the recompence due to his good ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, and alſo to chaſtiſe his villany, if he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived him. The Fiſher-men ſeeing their croſſe fortune, re-entred their Bark: for <hi>Argoſthenia</hi> had alſo bent a Bow, and was ready to ſhoot any that ſhould refuſe; determining to obey that croſſe neceſſity, which had yet ſucceeded more favourably than they hoped for: ſeeing that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving made <hi>Candia,</hi> where <hi>Arnaldo</hi> held corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondence of conſanguinity and friendſhip, he gave them fifty Ducats, and ſo ſent them home pleaſed, who came out ſo unwillingly.</p>
            <p>Here, becauſe the Cavalier would not make himſelf known in that condition, he bought with the Jewels of <hi>Argoſthenia</hi> honourable habits for both: and took with him a Page, and the old woman that ſtill followed them, ſayling along the Coaſts of the Iſle, till he came to <hi>Sidonia,</hi> where report went, that ſome Veſſels lay ready to ſet ſayl for <hi>Athens.</hi> And finding it juſt as he deſired, he embarqued in a Weſtern Veſſel, wherein ſayling proſperouſly as far as the Coaſts of <hi>Peloponneſus,</hi> the wind, which hitherto had fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured them with benign gales, now became treacherous, amaſſing Clouds in the aire, and rowling the Sea upſide down, with a Tempeſt the more ſad and dangerous, by how much the leſſe it was expected and feared. This ſtorm conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued three dayes and three nights in its fury, during which time, what they got of their voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age by advancing forward, they loſt again by dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving backward. On the fourth day, when as the weather began to calm, they could no longer
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:170451:75"/>ſteer their Veſſel, that was grown old already with many years continual ſcuffling with the waves: they ſplit her upon a Rock right againſt the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince of <hi>Argos;</hi> but with ſo good fortune to the Paſſengers and Marriners, that it endangered no mans life, and the damage of very little of the lading. Unfortunate <hi>Argoſthenia</hi> did very ill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent this adventure, and fell with impatience and anger into an extream diſtemper. And yet there was not wanting ſome, who leapt on ſhoar to free her from that danger, which they had run in the Tempeſtuouſneſſe of the Sea.</p>
            <p>The Captain of the ſhip had caſt his eye on this miraculous Creature: but reſpect to <hi>Arnaldo,</hi> who ſeemed to be of a quality not to be toucht without danger; and the turbulence of the Sea had put a ſtop to the licentious thoughts of this man; who, although inured from his Cradle to that ſordid kind of life, was too flexible of heart to withſtand the Amorous Darts, ſparkling in the lively eyes of incomparable <hi>Argoſthenia.</hi> But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing run upon the Rock through the neceſsity of the ſhip-wrack; while <hi>Arnaldo</hi> having accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modated his dear Spouſe the beſt he could, at the foot of a Grot under the cuſtody of her old ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant; and taking his Page with him, was gone to ſeek if there were any Harbour in that deſart, or any people to give them relief; There came the ſtrangeſt capriccio into the head of the villainous Captain that could be imagined: and it was, to raviſh away the young Lady, and clap her aboard the skiff, ſo to fly to the next ſhoar, before <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naldo</hi> ſhould return. The conception of ſo vitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perious an enterprize was inſtantly ſeconded
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:170451:76"/>with the execution. Thus, in deſpight of the remonſtrance made by the Maſter of the ſhip, which for his own intereſts would not conſent upon any terms to his departure; drawing to him ſome Souldiers and Marriners, he mounted the Schiff with the raviſhed Lady, who was ſenſeleſſe through exceſſive grief, and plying the Oars diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imbarqued in four hours ſpace upon the Coaſts of <hi>Epidaurus.</hi> But what a tranſport was <hi>Arnaldo</hi> in, when, returning from his fruitleſſe queſt to ſhelter, he found not the puple of his eye, which was ſo dear unto him; but ſo ſtrange a Tyranny of fortune, ever conſtant in abuſing him? I ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily believe that if <hi>Methrodorus,</hi> the Maſter of the ſhip, and other people that ſtayed with him, had not prevented him by main ſtrength, he would either have buried his ſword in his own breaſt, or would have flung himſelf with a more inevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table wrack, than that he had eſcap't, into the Sea. But firſt reſtrained by violence, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards recomforted in part by the perſwaſion of <hi>Methrodorus,</hi> which promiſed him to put him on ſhoar, and to overtake that fugitive Traitour before the infirmity of <hi>Argoſthenia</hi> would ſuffer him to arrive to the abominated end of his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns; he deſiſted from his deſperate determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Thereupon, <hi>Methrodorus</hi> collecting all the goods, both his own and others, that having not taken wet might beſt be ſaved; he hid them in that cave, to return, and fetch them when for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rune ſhould be more favourable, and ſet to build with his company (<hi>Arnaldo</hi> himſelf putting his hand to the work) of the reliques of the ſhip another ſchiff, &amp; in leſſe then twenty four hours
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:170451:76"/>equipped it out, with all neceſſary rigging, put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting themſelves in chaſe of the Captain, diſ-im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barquing the ſame evening in <hi>Epidaurus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Three moneths were already ſpent before that, being impeded by the wounds I had received, and by the Nuptials of <hi>Orſina</hi> and <hi>Euriſthus,</hi> I could begin my journey to <hi>Corinth.</hi> In the mean time ſeeing neither Meſſenger, nor Expreſſe from the <hi>Injur'd Lover,</hi> or his Miſtreſſe, I toucht up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Coaſts of <hi>Attica</hi> towards <hi>Negropont,</hi> to know ſomething of their voyage undertaken for <hi>Calcides;</hi> where, hearing a flying rumour of their Captivity, I was ready to die of grief. Yet not knowing whither to go, or what to do in their relief; I determined to paſſe by the way of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens</hi> to <hi>Corinth.</hi> Whither being arived, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving left the young couple among their friends, I had a deſire before my return into my own Countrey, to ſee ſome of the moſt fam'd Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of <hi>Peloponneſus.</hi> I made choice in this buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe (for Camrades) of <hi>Hercules</hi> and <hi>Alexander,</hi> two young Gentlemen of <hi>Meſſenia,</hi> which ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ended their ſtudies, were returning home; we went firſt from <hi>Corinth</hi> to <hi>Argos,</hi> where ſpend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but two dayes, we traveled towards <hi>Epidau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus.</hi> But being over-taken by night at a Village, ſix miles diſtant from the Citie, towards the Sea-Coaſts, whil'ſt that we were ſeeking amongſt thoſe Countrey people for a Lodging, we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countred with a Souldier, who enquired for a Litter, to fetch from a place not above half a mile off, a ſick young Lady, which he ſaid was ſhip-wrack't in the late Tempeſt. <hi>Alexander</hi> my Camrade, was the moſt capricious man in
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:170451:77"/>the world; and alwayes a deſirer of rambling adventures: Having therefore heard ſo much, it was needleſſe to perſwade him to go ſee this Damſell. And becauſe the Souldier ſaid, that ſhe was alone with one onely maid, and him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, pretending to be her ſervant; with a noble freedom, he offered (ſeeing there was not one of thoſe clowns that would ſet foot out of doors at that time of night about ſuch a buſineſſe) himſelf to ſerve that Lady, with his own Horſe to bring her to ſome place of accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>The proffer of our Comrade, obliged us to tender the like courteſy; but being rudely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſed by the Souldier, directly refuſing our ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vility and generoſity, <hi>Alexander</hi> perſiſted the the more in his humour of ſeeing that Lady: And turning to me, laughing; Sir, ſaid he, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe my indiſcretion. Night is already ſhut in, and this clowniſh rout ſhew themſelves unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to entertain us. We have been heretofore ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed to watching in our wild night-rounds at <hi>Corinth,</hi> and therefore it will do us no great hurt, to prolong our journy for two or three hours, till we come to ſome Town, where we may meet with lodgings fit for us, going firſt to ſee this Lady, to tender to her in perſon our ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice; and, Who knows, but we may find her as courteous, as her ſervant is rude and uncivill? I, that was born ſtill to make my friend's plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure my Law, readily proffered my ſelf to wait on him; but <hi>Hercules</hi> did exceedingly oppoſe it; were it that, wearyed by his journy, he deſired to take his reſt, or elſe, that fore-ſeeing in his
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:170451:77"/>mind the approaching danger, he would give way to ſuch an impulſe.</p>
            <p>Yet <hi>Alexander</hi> prevailing, and taking along with us, for our guid, one of thoſe Country-fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, we rid towards that place: where in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of a ſick Lady, we found ſix men of ſavage aſpect, and in a deportment (excepting one of them) liker gally-ſlaves than Souldiers. Yet we perceived by their poſture, that either they ſtood in doubt of themſelves, or kept ſome ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret they deſired not to have known. And we were confirmed in our opinion, in that at our appearing, they had either put out or hid two torches, which they carryed to illuminate the darkneſſe of the night, which, by this time, had wholy overſpread the great face of Heaven; yet it's obſcurity began to diminiſh, by reaſon of the exceeding clarity of the Moon, than ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Hercules</hi> by this time half angry, ſaid to <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander:</hi> See here the young Lady, which you expected to complement: <hi>Alexander</hi> laugh'd, and replyed; Even from the antient <hi>Sileni,</hi> aroſe matters of wonder, and who knows but theſe <hi>Cyplop's</hi> faces, may wait on ſome <hi>Venus?</hi> Yea, replyed I, but there being no fire in this Forge, we go in ſome danger, and inſtead of a <hi>Venus</hi> that we would conduct to a logding, we may find ſome <hi>Vulcan,</hi> that may throw a hammer at our heads. We had, at our firſt coming, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt our Guide, and, to give no ſuſpition of our intent, we freely rode on in our way: Being at laſt come ſo neer as to diſcern them; and, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſing in a tone, onely underſtood by our

Alexander</hi> laughing, Thus (ſaid he) they are ſerved, that in a dark night follow a blind leader. We thought to have found a Lady, but we have miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed our intentions, and in a fancy loſt our way. It matters not much, ſaid I: fot however this Lady have ſlighted us, the Moon ſhall ſerve as a guid to light us. Whilſt we were thus talking, we heard the languiſhing voyce of a weak wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man crying; Ah, Sir Knight! And while we were hearkening from whence the ſound came, ſhe ſighing, rehearſed the ſame words: Ah, Sir Knight, help the betray'd <hi>Argoſthenia.</hi> Theſe lamentable words pierced my heart as ſo many darts, and preſently calling to mind the loſſe of that Lady, I concluded, that theſe muſt needs be Pirats, that had raviſhed her. Yet becauſe I would not raſhly conclude of things, before I knew the truth; I entreated him (and it was the Captain himſelf, her raviſher) that ſeemed to be the Commander of the reſt, to tell me Who that Lady was, that implored my ſuccour: and wherefore? His anſwer was, in putting his hand to his ſword, and buckler, to defend his Rape.</p>
            <p>We were three, Six our Adverſaries; and I thought, I heard ſome noyſe from the Sea-ward, which were two Sea-men his Accomplices, who hearing of our coming, made towards us. I rid up full carier at the Captain aſſuring my ſelf, that, the head being once ſuppreſt, the members would of themſelves abandon the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſe.
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:170451:79"/>But I was deceived; for although he ſoon paid the penalty of his villany, falling mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally wounded under my Horſe's feet, who diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patcht him with the fury of his kicks; his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions ſo ſtoutly perſiſted in his revenge, that, after a long conteſt, there was ſlain beſides himſelf, another of the enemies; and <hi>Hercules; Alexander</hi> dangerouſly wounded, and his horſe diſtended upon the earth. For my part, I knew not what I did in that night-ſcuffle, but this I am certain, that I never eſcap't any perill with ſo little hurt in my perſon, as in this, though ſo hot and long, conflict. And happily it was the bountifull diſpoſure of Heaven, which would not in ſuch neceſſity, deprive the unfortunate <hi>Argoſthenia</hi> of my aſſiſtance.</p>

The young Lady ſeeing me draw neer, and knowing me more by my deportment, than
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:170451:80"/>viſage, had a deſire to get up to receive me, and to give me her hand, but could not: Whereat, beholding a Lady of that nobility, virtue, and gentleneſſe, in ſo ſad a condition; I ſtood a good ſpace tranſported by the conſiderations of the rigours of Fortune, exerciſed over the lives of Mortalls, permitted by divine Providence, for our correction and inſtruction. But retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to my ſelf, I did my beſt endeavour to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort the Lady, and enquired of her, how her affairs ſtood, and of <hi>Arnaldo:</hi> ſhe briefly rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted all that had befaln her, from her departure from me, to that inſtant in which the Captain had ſtoln her away. Underſtanding by her rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that the Skiff was left tyed to that ſhoare, I deſired <hi>Alexander</hi> to ride and ſee if happily there were any of the Mariners left; for there being no other way to ſecure <hi>Argoſthenia,</hi> than by conducting her that way to <hi>Epidaurus</hi> (more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, it was requiſite, to take care for the body of our unfortunate Camrade, and for his own ſafty) thinking to win them with good treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and by taking no notice of their default in that deteſtable enterpriſe. He went, but found onely the Bark: whereupon diſpairing of help, any other way, I reſumed my former familiarity with <hi>Argoſthenia,</hi> and carryed her in my arms unto that place: where we found ſome ſmall commodity of meat, and of a bed for the Lady. I made a fire and ſerved her for Nurſe, Phyſician, and keeper, whereat ſhe was ſo af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, that ſhe continually wept for tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. Next, I made uſe of a Secret, taught me by the fair <hi>Orfina,</hi> in order to the cure of <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander;</hi>
               <pb n="141" facs="tcp:170451:80"/>And making him alſo to take a little reſt, I returned with the old woman to the fields, and laying the body of <hi>Hercules</hi> upon his horſe, I got him alſo aboard the boat, and hid him in a private place of the ſame, to the end he ſhould not with his ſight trouble the mind of my pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents; and laſt of all cloſed my eyes for a little while, to eſſay the dulcity of ſleep, cloſe by my horſe, which that night, inſtead of hay and provender, fed on bisket and poudred bief, like a Mariner.</p>
            <p>Day appearing, and my company awaking, we diſcovered a new ſcene of wonder upon that ſhore; for <hi>Argoſthenia,</hi> in the apprehenſions of joy, for ſeeing her ſelf delivered from the inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious hands of the barbarous Captain, and being again in my protection; having taken a long ſleep, ſhe feigned her ſelf ſo very much amen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that raiſing her ſelf up in her bed, ſhe dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from her face a profuſion of rayes of ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar beauty, as if ſhe had never had the leaſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpoſition, or trouble. And <hi>Alexander</hi> on the other ſide, perceived himſelf reaſonable well of his wounds; but I deſired him before he ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to expect the operation of the receipt, and with the woman's help prepared our repaſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween merry and ſad; merry, for the recovery of <hi>Argoſthenia,</hi> and hope of reſtoring her preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to <hi>Arnaldo:</hi> ſad, for the death of <hi>Hercules,</hi> a Gentleman, for his worthy qualities, deſerving a longer life. This done, and having procured from the places adjacent, with much trouble, and large promiſes, two Fiſher-men, that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook to carry us in that Schiff to <hi>Epidaurus;</hi>
               <pb n="140" facs="tcp:170451:81"/>whilſt we were making ready dinner, there came thither-ward a Judge in matters Criminall, with his Court, that were come from the City, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the information of the Peaſants there abouts, to take cognizance of the paſſages the night be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and to viſit the dead bodyes, which ſtill lay in the field. This pleaſed not me a jot; for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though right was on my ſide, yet having learnt, to my great coſt, what I might expect (though ſecured by my innocence,) among ſuch kind of people; I took a reſolution not to imbroyl my ſelf with them. Thereupon, making my horſe to be brought into the Veſſell, and turning looſe that of <hi>Hercules;</hi> I bid the Fiſher-men to put off from ſhore, and to ſteer towards the rock where <hi>Argoſthenia</hi> hinted we ſhould find her ſhipwrackt <hi>Arnaldo.</hi> The Fiſher-men would by no means obey, ſaying, They were onely en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged to land us at <hi>Epidaurus:</hi> beſides, there was no ſecurity to paſſe with but two Oares, and ſuch a burden, through the main Sea. When <hi>Alexander</hi> heard this, ſtarting up from the place where he lay, and overcoming with his terrible<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe my complacency, which would have ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſed them with intreaties and rewards, he threatened to kill them preſently, if they did not forthwith fall to their Oares. They ſeeing ſo troubleſome a tempeſt to ariſe, turned their courſe the way, that againſt their wills he made them ſteer; but whether it were their villany or their ignorance, after that we had ſpent the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidue of that day, in toſſing to and fro in the Sea, about three hours within night, we arived at the rock, whence <hi>Arnaldo</hi> was departed ſix hours be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, for <hi>Epidaurus.</hi>

            <pb n="141" facs="tcp:170451:81"/>
            <p>Meeting therefore with nothing but the frag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the ſplit Veſſell, and the chips made about the new Schiff, I was thereat exceſſively vexed and confounded; not knowing which way to go to find <hi>Arnaldo,</hi> and deliver him his Spouſe; for as yet ſhe was not his Wife. But <hi>Alexander</hi> fell into ſo great a fury, that if <hi>Argo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſthenia</hi> and I, had not put a ſtop to his frenſy, he would have thrown the Fiſher-men into the Sea, to whoſe crime he attributed our tarriance. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unwilling therefore, to put to Sea in a new Voiage in the night, with ſo unfaithfull guides, and in ſo ſmall a Boat, we acommodated our ſelves the beſt we could in that place. And leſt that, whilſt we were aſleep, the Fiſhers ſhould deceive us, we ſo bound the Bark with chains, and cables to the ſhore, that we were ſure it could not ſtir thence, without our conſent. But this prevention was to no purpoſe, for they expected when we ſhould be aſleep, having learnt already, that in thoſe grotts there were hid ſome goods after the ſhip wrack; and ſoftly getting a ſhore, they robb'd ſome cheſts, upon which they did ſwim back to their own ſhore. The firſt that waked upon break of day, was <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goſthenia,</hi> and, without looking on any thing elſe, ſhe alſo landed about her own affairs, and there found ſcattered on the ground, divers fardles of goods and writings, either faln by chance, or ſlung there on purpoſe by the Fiſher-men, as being things that might impeach them. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, being a Lady of a vivacious and nimble ingenuity, ſhe gathered up the papers, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tying the bundles, found a box of Orientall
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:170451:82"/>Turchoiſes, worth about two thoſand Ducats, and ſome five hundred Ducats in ready money. She laid them up in ſafety, for her own uſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt any misfortune that might happen, and ſo returned into the Schiff. And by this time, the Day having aſſumed it's proper ſplendour, ſhe was much troubled to miſſe the Fiſher-men; &amp; inſtantly awaking me, ſhe ſhewed me what ſhe had found, and advertiſed me of their flight. But by reaſon I was unwilling to humour Fortune ſo far, as to expreſſe any alteration at ſo great an act of her Tyranny; I put a ſmile upon the matter, and looking on the Stones, and reſtoring them to the Lady, to diſpoſe of them at her pleaſure; I had a curioſity to turn over thoſe Papers. By the ruſling whereof <hi>Alexander</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing awakned, I with a ſmiling action, told him, Camrade: If fortune hath for ſome dayas con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined us to this cliff, ſhe hath alſo provided us matter of entertainment. We have here biſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket, and wine; fleſh, and fiſh, for above a month: Wood we ſhall not want; either for fuell, or to defend us, if need require, from the incommodity of the ſeaſon, which was in the latter end of <hi>Autumn,</hi> towards the beginning of Winter. Courage yet, that, let the worſt come that can, we ſhall live even in this Deſart.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Alexander</hi> ſmiled, &amp; ſaid; You have a brave time on<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, Sir, &amp; you have good reaſon ſo to eſteem it; for in the company of ſo noble and virtuous a Lady, you might ſtyle your ſelf Happy, though reduced to greater hardſhips. But I, what ſhall I do, in ſo deſolate a place? Dear <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander,</hi> ſaid I you make too bad a conſtruction of
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:170451:82"/>my heart, ſince the ſervice I owe to this Lady, is the onely thing that troubleth me in this ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude; not, but that I eſteem it a glory to be able to ſerve her; but becauſe I cannot ſee her in ſo much miſery without a ſenſible affliction, nor call to mind the Knight her Spouſe without ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſive diſguſts. But theſe are onely words: the buſineſſe is, that we muſt think upon our ſafety. Here we cannot hold our ſelves ſecure; for ſhips never ſayl this way, except that of our unfortunate friends: and were it ſo, that ſome ſhould by chance come, we ſhould be ſtill un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain of our lives. To think to get to land of our ſelves, having never in all our lives touched Oars, or Sayls, would be a piece of ſolemn folly. I have already computed that we have proviſion to ſerve us for five, or ſix weeks. This confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, let us diſpoſe our ſelves to paſſe away the time, ſince it cannot be with much joy, yet with the leaſt annoy that prudence will permit; and accuſtom our ſelves every day to manage theſe <hi>Maritime Pennes,</hi> that we may learn upon this great <hi>Book</hi> of the water to <hi>Write</hi> our ſelves an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal name. Sir, ſaid <hi>Alexander</hi> command what you pleaſe, for I will make you free and abſolute maſter of my will.</p>
            <p>Having thus concluded of things, my firſt thought was to make a Coffin, to bury there the body of <hi>Hercules;</hi> and there was no great diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty in it, for there was reliques of Wood, Iron, and Pitch, ſufficient to have raiſed an ample ſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture. This done, and leaving the old woman to dreſſe Dinner, and look to my horſe, we walked till Dinner time to view the Rock; and <hi>Argo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſthenia</hi>
               <pb n="146" facs="tcp:170451:83"/>making a Bow of green wood, and ſome ruſtick Arrows of drie ſplinters, found her ſelf an excellent divertiſement, by ſhooting ſuch Birds as flew thither, from the adjoyning conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent. Having dined, we ſpent the reſt of that day, part in merriment, and part in raiſing a Cab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bin to lye in a-nights. The day following we ſpent alſo in thoſe, and ſuch like other new re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creations, having learn't of the woman how to angle with the hook and line; who was therein moſt dextrous. On the ſixth day of this our <hi>Hermetical</hi> courſe of life, about noon we diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered a Fly-boat making towards us; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon drawing our Bark aſhore, we fortified our ſelves ſo, that we could have defended our ſelves with eaſe, from a greater number in that Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainous and impenetrable Fort; eſpecially with the aſſiſtance of <hi>Argoſthenia,</hi> who being perfect in Archery, could have ſent death at a good di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance to our Enemies.</p>
            <p>They of the ſhip perceiving our deſign, put forth a white flag in token of peace and friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip; <hi>Alexander,</hi> for all this, as being alwayes a Lover of blows and quarrels, would not agree that we ſhould truſt them to approach us; but <hi>Argoſthenia</hi> having diſcovered amongſt them the Maſter of the ſhip-wrack't Veſſel, ſhe took occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to treat him courteouſly to get ſome news of <hi>Arnaldo:</hi> We made therefore to underſtand at a good diſtance, that we intended to let none land but onely himſelf and one companion. He readily accorded to our pleaſure, being the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander of all the reſt; but coming on ſhoar, he ſtood like one half dead to ſee <hi>Argoſthenia,</hi> with
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:170451:83"/>a countenance more reſembling a Goddeſſe then a Mortal; and, but that he ſaw her raviſhed, and carried away with his own eyes, he would have ſworn ſhe had never ſtirr'd thence. The firſt word we asked him was, What was become of <hi>Arnaldo,</hi> and he told us, that having learnt by the Proceſſe formed by the Criminal Court, the death of the Captain her Raviſher, and that ſhe was put to Sea for ſome other place with two young Cavaliers in her Company; whereas be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he was comforted with the death of that Traitor, he now received a greater affliction in this new ſeparation; having a conceit that one of thoſe young Gentlemen was the ſame Knight who, ſaid he, was deſtinated by heaven, perpetual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to oblige him, ſo that he could never live in quiet within himſelf for him; having therefore now three dayes ſince departed towards <hi>Corinth,</hi> in hope to find him there together with his Spouſe. But three dayes after his departure, he the ſaid <hi>Methrodorus</hi> had heard ſome rumour, that we were upon that Rock; for two Fiſher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of thoſe Coaſts being accuſed of having ſold goods that were prohibited, and being ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended by Juſtice, and having confeſt againſt themſelves, where they had done that robbery, they were likewiſe accuſed of their errour in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandoning us in that manner. And that he was come thither to fetch away the reſidue of the goods hid in thoſe caves, and to ſee withall if he might meet with the happineſſe of being able in any meaſure to ſerve us. I knew what conſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction <hi>Arnaldo</hi>'s turbulent nature would put up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on my actions, but I reſerved my thoughts to
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:170451:84"/>my ſelf, thanking <hi>Methrodorus</hi> for his courteſie, and ſaying, that we would onely trouble him once more ſo far as to borrow ſome of his Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riners to go as far as <hi>Argos,</hi> or <hi>Corinth;</hi> for that we intended to go thither in ſearch of <hi>Arnal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Methrodorus</hi> preſently made a voluntary offer to wait upon us himſelf to that Port with two of his Marriners, which attended him in that Fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boat. Then <hi>Argoſthenia</hi> with a Soul truely ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous took him aſide, and ſhewed him what ſhe had found in Money and Jewels, asking him, If they were his. He anſwered, they were; but that he preſented her with them: and becauſe ſhe ſhould not think that he was ſo liberal of things that were loſt, giving her that which was not in his power, he took his other riches out of the Cave, and made her an exceeding noble Preſent of Cloaths, both Silk and Gold, of Oriental work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manſhip very beautifull and coſtly. Then la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding his Bark, he kept with himſelf onely ſome of the preciouſeſt things, and he ſent her under conduct of his Mate towards <hi>Athens,</hi> whither he before was bound, that he might ſtay himſelf with us to guide his Skiffe.</p>
            <p>Then I complemented <hi>Alexander,</hi> entreating him to acquaint me with his intention, for I thought it not civil longer to impede his return into his Countrey. But he being offended by my Courteſie, ſaid, He knew not in honour how to deſert us, till he ſaw us in a place of ſecurity. So we both mounted the Skiff, which was excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent well provided for all occurrences, ſteering with a proſperous wind towards <hi>Corinth;</hi> and
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:170451:84"/>coming to fall upon a diſcourſe about the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings found by <hi>Argoſthenia</hi> we came to know, that <hi>Methrodorus</hi> was not what he appeared to be, a Maſter of a <hi>Cretan</hi> ſhip, but a Knight of <hi>Calcides,</hi> father of <hi>Caliſthenes,</hi> formerly ſpoken of as the Lover of <hi>Argoſthenia,</hi> treacherouſly ſlain by her brother <hi>Ariſtheus</hi> in <hi>Athens.</hi> Whereupon the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrections of <hi>Calcides</hi> enſuing, which had almoſt put the whole Iſle into a revolt, he was forced to depart thence with the confiſcation of his goods, and went to <hi>Candia,</hi> where he built the ſhip that was caſt away, and had ſo good ſucceſſe in the management of that imployment, that he was at that preſent worth little leſſe then twenty thouſand Ducats, which he had in <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens. Argoſthenia</hi> wept exceedingly at the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorous remembrance of her betrayed <hi>Caliſthenes;</hi> nor was <hi>Methrodorus</hi> leſſe moved when knowing her for the innocent cauſe of all his loſſes and misfortunes, he underſtood, moreover, that ſhe was already contracted to <hi>Arnaldo,</hi> a Knight of the bloud Royal of <hi>Thebes;</hi> and might one day aſcend the Throne of <hi>Negropont.</hi> He reſpected her therefore thence-forward as his Lady and Miſtreſſe, and he entreated her, that at her return to her own Countrey, whither he offered to carry her, ſhe would pleaſe to think upon his ruined family, and reſtore it by ſome act of bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficence. <hi>Argoſthenia</hi> promiſed that when it ſhould be in her power ſhe would remember him, not ſo much for being the father of <hi>Cali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſthenes,</hi> and injuriouſly perſecuted, as for the Courteſies ſhewn her in that her neceſsity. In ſuch kind of recognitions, remonſtrances, and
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:170451:85"/>promiſes, it grew towards the evening, when <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throdorus</hi> adviſed us to land at a little Caſtle be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the confines of <hi>Argos</hi> and <hi>Corinth,</hi> where he aſſured us we ſhould find good accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Here therefore we landed, and reſted that night, when upon the next morning going out of my Chamber to viſit <hi>Argoſthenia,</hi> I met the Hoſt, which attended to preſent me with a Letter. I knew it preſently to be from <hi>Alexander,</hi> and ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning it with exceeding great commotion of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, I found that it ſaid,</p>

                  <p>I <hi>Accompt it my happy fortune to have had an oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to ſerve you, together with the Princeſſe</hi> Argoſthenia; <hi>for the adventures that accoſted me within this few dayes have given me advice, what I may hope from the World, and of that which I ought to procure to my ſelf in Heaven.</hi> Argoſthenia <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing born to be the innocent occaſion of ruin to many, I will make uſe of it as a juſt motive to provide for my own ſafety. I confeſſe, Sir, that her prodigious beauty hath made a deep impreſſion in my heart; but were it ſo that ſhe had not been eſpouſed to</hi> Arnaldo, <hi>her being in your company would have taught me to behold her with a mortified eye, that ſo I might not offend, ſo much as in the leaſt thought, either her reputation, or my own fidelity. Yet I would have eſteemed it my great happineſſe to have ſerved her, though with this neceſſity of looking upon my ſelf as dead; had not the relations of</hi> Methrodorus, <hi>and our late accidents opened my eyes, and let me ſee,
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:170451:85"/>that by this way I took, together with the troop of a thouſand other Wretches, I precipitated my ſelf, for her ſake, into the exteameſt abyſſe of Calamity. I determined therefore to ceaſe following her, not through cowardiſe, but diſcretion, it being a mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt madneſſe to dye in a complement. Amongſt the Papers of</hi> Methrodorus, <hi>I read a relation, that in the coaſts of</hi> Marmarica, <hi>there is a ſolitary Society of men, ſeparated in cuſtoms from the confines of humanity, for to live according to the uſe of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. Thither I go to be buryed alive, with the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of</hi> Hercules, <hi>which ſhall ſerve me for a profound Lecture of celeſtiall Philoſophy. Pardon me, Sir, if I depart thus abruptly; ſince I did not conceive it good, to confront my debility to your moſt friendly converſation, which would have detained me in the ſhackles of a content, too ſenſible for me to have diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingaged my ſelf from, without an inſupportable re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment. I carry the Skiff of</hi> Methrodorus <hi>away with me, and one of his Mariners, which is wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to follow me in ſo generous a reſolution till death; and I will make uſe of my own hands, in the voluntary labour of the Oar, learnt for the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of our bodily ſafety, to acquire to my ſelf the precious reward of a celeſtiall life.

            <p>THe ſenſe of friendſhip rendred this depriva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Alexander,</hi> inconceivably grievous; but Prudence leſſened my affliction, thinking
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:170451:86"/>that he had choſen the better part, and I began to deſire, to viſite my ſelf one day, the Deſarts of <hi>Marmarica.</hi> I imparted this paſſage to <hi>Argo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſthenia,</hi> and <hi>Methrodorus;</hi> and they ſeemed ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to blame, than commend it. <q>And <hi>Argo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſthenia</hi> ſaid, that, Cavaliers of <hi>Alexander</hi>'s quality, born into the World for the profit of Mortalls, ought not to deprive themſelves of the means to employ thoſe Talents, to the common benefit, which Heaven had lent them, for this very end, to ſerve to mankind in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall: I defended the reſolution of my friend, alledging, that all thoſe who had obtained from Heaven the rare qualities of Wit and Valour, were not obliged to employ them to the benefits of others, with a manifeſt perill to themſelves. For, Heaven is alſo wont, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive men of the favours conceded them, as a puniſhment of their ingratitude and unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſſe, ſeeing Virtue is for the moſt part rather perſecuted than acknowledged. Again, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution of <hi>Alexander</hi> well conſidered, his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiredneſſe, may prove to the World a greater benefit than his commerce with men, whilſt that, in converſation, by reaſon of his capric<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cio's and adoleſcentiall vanities, he was inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and prejudiciall to many, and in ſeque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrative ſolitarineſſe, he may be able with this integrity of his life and converſation, to come forth for an univerſall benefit into the World.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Well, ſaid <hi>Methrodorus,</hi> Who knows, but that even this reſolution may ariſe from a fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſticall humour, and not from the invitation
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:170451:86"/>of Heaven? It concerns not us, replyed I, to penetrate into theſe ſecrets; in the mean time, we know, that Heaven ſometimes makes uſe of ſuch like means, to extract a generous Virtue out of a conſtrained neceſſity. We ought al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes to cenſure well of thoſe things, which ever appear good in themſelves. For although the iniquity of man convert theſe into the worſt, yet it doth not follow, that the <hi>good</hi> is not ſtill <hi>good</hi> in it ſelf; although the perverſity of ſome, do ſiniſterly uſe it. Certainly <hi>Alexander</hi> hath done well, to prefer his own ſafety to others benefit, for ſo exerciſing his proper goodneſſe, he ſhall live without injury, yea, rather with commodity to others: whereas in a Knightly life, although he might have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fited ſome, that could hardly ever be without the prejudice of many. For although he me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rited ſometimes in defence of Innocence, and in chaſtiſment of Villany; yet it more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently came to paſſe, that he undid himſelf and others, in a vanity, in a humour, or in a complement.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Thus I argued: but I ſaw that this <hi>Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy</hi> little liked <hi>Methrodorus,</hi> immerg'd in the thoughts of recovering his Houſe from the dyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſters, occaſioned by the Loves of <hi>Caliſthenes</hi> and <hi>Argoſthenia;</hi> and <hi>it</hi> did as much diſpleaſe <hi>Argoſthenia,</hi> fearing that I alſo intended to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert her, to follow the track of <hi>Alexander:</hi> and therefore I changed diſcourſe, deſiring <hi>Methro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorus</hi> to adviſe us, concerning the manner of our Voyage; for that being as yet uncerrain of find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Arnaldo</hi> at <hi>Corinth,</hi> and being loth to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturb
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:170451:87"/>
               <hi>Argoſthenia</hi> with a journey by Land, I judged ſhe might tranſport her ſelf commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly by Sea to <hi>Athens,</hi> and ſtay there in a houſe which I kept there till ſuch time as I had over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken <hi>Arnaldo,</hi> which by making long journies over land I might ſoon do.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Methrodorus</hi> was pleaſed with my deſign, but <hi>Argoſthenia</hi> would not agree to it, fearing ſtill that I contrived pretexts to abandon her. But having promiſed, (whether I found <hi>Arnaldo</hi> or no) to be at <hi>Athens,</hi> within the ſpace of fifteen dayes, to wait upon her, ſhe condeſcended, though in my judgment it was ſtill very unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly.</p>
            <p>This being reſolved on, we proceeded to act it; <hi>Methrodorus</hi> hiring a Bark, and putting out inſtantly to Sea; and I began at the ſame inſtant, by Land, my journy towards <hi>Corinth.</hi> And juſt as I entred the houſe of <hi>Euriſthus,</hi> I met full of ſorrow and ſadneſſe the fair <hi>Orſina;</hi> and after many throbs and ſighs, ſhe related to me, that the <hi>Injur'd Lover</hi> had been at that City to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire of me and <hi>Argoſthenia,</hi> and <hi>Euriſthus</hi> had entertained him at his houſe, where hearing how much I took to heart his dyſaſters, and what di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence I had uſed to learn his captivity, to ſet him at liberty, it partly mitigated, if not who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly depoſed the maligne ſuſpitions of his Jelou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy, that held him in a continuall torment, to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend a while among thoſe, to whom I was conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually writing ſome thing or other of news, concerning me. But ſeeing that, contrary to my cuſtom, I had now let paſſe ten dayes, without writing to them, or ſending any meſſage, he
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:170451:87"/>went thence that day, upon a certain rumour, that, ſayling towards the Iſland of <hi>Aegina,</hi> I was caſt away with a Knight and a Lady in my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany; and fell into ſuch a paſſion, that incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinently leaving <hi>Corinth,</hi> he ſwore he would not ſurvive the death of his unfortunate Spouſe. Wherewith <hi>Euriſthus</hi> being alſo extreamly affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, he went preſently to the haven and hired a <hi>Feluca</hi> for <hi>Epidaurus,</hi> to inform himſelf of the truth of that Adventure. Underſtanding this, and being glutted and ſated with ſo many ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gours and errours of Fortune and Love, I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted <hi>Orſina</hi> the beſt I could, in ſuch an inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience of affairs; yet ſhe would not let me depart (at leaſt, till <hi>Euriſthus</hi> his return;) but becauſe I would not fail in my word to <hi>Argoſthenia,</hi> nor omit any thing on my part, to ſatisfy my debt of Amity with <hi>Arnaldo,</hi> I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently left that City, and having gone about ſix miles, I was thinking to turn my courſe towards the Province of <hi>Megara,</hi> when, behold, I ſaw a Currier and his guide, coming full ſpeed down a hill before me, to whom I advanced, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, From whence he came poſting with ſo much haſt. He gave me no anſwer, but ſtill put on in his way. But, I, know not by what ſpirit inſtigated, croſſing the way before him with my Horſe, worth twenty of his; I renew'd my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt. He anſwered, that ſuch Queryes and Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronts ought not to be offered to publique Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters; and I replyed that I had not in the leaſt offended the publique liberty, with a requeſt of meer complement; beſides that, being the rode to <hi>Boeotia,</hi> I was ſo concern'd in thoſe quarters,
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:170451:88"/>that I was intereſted in the knowledge of ſuch novelties as Fortune might there have plotted. He looked ſtedfaſtly on me, asking, If I were not a foraign Gentleman, dwelling in <hi>Attica,</hi> and accuſtomed to be ſometimes at <hi>Thebes:</hi> And underſtanding that I was; he proceeded to beg my name: with which being ſatisfied, he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded; It is you Sir, that I am in ſearch of; for by the King's Commiſſion, <hi>Olympia,</hi> the Aunt of <hi>Arnaldo,</hi> hath ſent me to you, with theſe Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, directed to <hi>Corinth,</hi> to the houſe of <hi>Euri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſthus</hi> and <hi>Orſina.</hi> Now Heaven be praiſed, that I have ſhortned my journy by many miles. I took the pacquet, opened it, and there found Letters to <hi>Arnaldo</hi> and <hi>Argoſthenia,</hi> both with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any ſeal, together with this, directed to my ſelf.</p>

By the incloſed Letters you may ſee, Sir, what we have thought fit to write to my Nephew, and his Conſort, and I intreat you, by the Love you bear them both, and by your native courteſy, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſe your intereſts with</hi> Arnaldo <hi>and</hi> Argoſthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia, <hi>that being now diſ-ingaged from their miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adventures, which have ſo long oppreſſed them, they would apply their minds to thoſe hopes, to which their births and divine Providence hath called them. If you gain no more hereby, yet you may reſt aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that by your ſervice and ſatisfaction herein, I ſhall for ever be ingaged to be more then all others, generous Sir,</hi>

Now we are
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:170451:89"/>exceeding glad to hear, that before we could effect any thing, you had the Fortune to get free, together with your Spouſe.

            <p>BUt the Letter to <hi>Argoſthenia,</hi> was onely full of feminine tenderneſſe, condoling, and congratulating, with referring her in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion, to what ſhe had writ to <hi>Arnaldo</hi> and <hi>Philiternus,</hi> as to the buſineſſe of her return to that houſe, which was now doubly hers. This news, though it came not to me altogether un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expected, yet I was thereat greatly perplexed, for it bereft me of my reſt, and greatly troubled
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:170451:89"/>me; in which I was conſtrained to Combat more with domeſtick than forrain Enemies; for it ſeeming impoſſible to me that the fraternal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence <hi>Argoſthenia</hi> had in me, ſhould not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes retain a continual apprehenſion of ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the ever jealous, and ever amorous ſpirit of <hi>Arnaldo,</hi> threatning to break out one day into ſome great diſorder; as alſo on the other ſide loving that gentle Cavalier with a moſt cordial affection, and being by him truely rebeloved: for I knew very well that to ſuch ſuſpicious ſpirits even the <hi>Atomes</hi> in the Aire are wont to occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion trouble and inquietude. Yet I forbore this thought for that time, and diſmiſt the guide that accompanied this meſſenger, taking him with me towards the Citie of <hi>Eulixis,</hi> where I held ſome intereſt and correſpondence, gathering of him as I went, perfect information of the news of <hi>Boeotia</hi> and <hi>Negropont.</hi> Being come to <hi>Eleuxis,</hi> I was encountred with a ſtrange accident of <hi>Euriſthus</hi> being condemned to death, and <hi>Arnaldo</hi>'s being a priſoner with that Governour.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Furiſthus</hi> having gone to <hi>Egina,</hi> and finding no intelligence of what he deſired about my perſon, he was perſwaded by an <hi>Eleuxin</hi> Lady, that had means lay in that Iſle, to ſerve her with his <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luca</hi> to <hi>Eleuxis; Euriſthus</hi> knew nothing how that ſhe was confined thither by the Governour, upon occaſion of her husbands being ſlain by one of her Lovers. He came therefore with all ſecurity by midnight (the very time elected by <hi>Liviana,</hi> that ſhe might not be known) to the Citie, where walking freely up and down, he caſually met <hi>Arnaldo</hi> the next morning, as he
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:170451:90"/>was juſt departing for <hi>Athens,</hi> in the ſame de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperate condition as we have ſaid, for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed ſhipwrack of <hi>Argoſthenia</hi> and <hi>Philiternus.</hi> He walked with ſuch diſtraction and aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that although he met <hi>Euriſthus,</hi> he ſo little regarded him that he did not know him. But <hi>Euriſthus</hi> awaking him by his civility out of that profound trance, and imparting to him ſomething of what Fame muttered in our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice, he invited him to ſtay awhile in the houſe of that Lady, with an intention of wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon him with his <hi>Feluca</hi> to <hi>Athens,</hi> whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he deſigned to go the better to inform him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf of my proceedings in my own houſe. The Lady made great entertainment for the Knight, and perceiving him to be notwithſtanding his trouble and melancholly (that had ſo injur'd him) the goodlieſt perſon in the World, in a flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing age of twenty five years, and again ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving dedicated her ſelf to ſenſuality, ſhe took a conceit to allay her diſſoluteneſſe in this her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarity. She invited him therefore to Dinner; <hi>an occaſion, proper, by the intervention of</hi> Bacchus, <hi>to introduce the intereſts of</hi> Venus; and began with her procacious glances, and geſtures, and licentious and laſcivious words, to inſtil into the mind of the Cavalier the incentives of her luſt. <hi>Arnaldo,</hi> who had alwayes loved more like a contemplative <hi>Philoſopher</hi> then a carnal <hi>Amoriſt,</hi> not yet knowing what the malice of women was, ſmiled to himſelf at ſuch pretentions, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving in his external actions a modeſt affabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, he with a marvellous ſweetneſſe deluded her. The woman hereat not a jot diſcouraged, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terr'd
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:170451:90"/>from giving her deſigns a birth by the Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wifry of ſome better machinations, prevailed ſo far, with the help of <hi>Euriſthus,</hi> that ſhe got the Knight to ſtay there a night longer. Which come, ſhe depoſed all feminine modeſty, and went to find him in his own bed, to throw her ſelf naked into his embraces. But not being en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained, but rather diſdain'd by the generous <hi>Arnaldo,</hi> which would conſerve the faith of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimony immaculate to his ſpouſe; ſhe was mov'd with ſuch ſcorn, that, like a diſſolute woman, ſhe converted her laſcivious deſire into inveterate hatred, contriving for revenge of her repulſe, the ſtrangeſt villany that could poſſibly enter into the heart of woman. She made it be ſignified to the Governour, that when he had revok't her baniſhment, ſhe would put into his power her husband's murtherer.</p>
            <p>The Governour accepted the offer, deſiring to get that Traytor into his hands; and ſhe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained <hi>Arnaldo</hi> with ſundry inventions, hiding his horſe's furniture in her houſe: but yet at laſt being offended with ſuch entertainment, &amp; pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring to be gone, the Provoſt of the Citie at the ſame inſtant broke into the houſe with the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt fury in the World with all his Officers, and beſet the Knight to carry him to priſon: Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous <hi>Euriſthus</hi> ſeeing this, put himſelf upon a daring, but imprudent Enterprize; bearing away no prize of honour by contracting with ſuch a rout of Catch-poles, from whom onely to fly was honourable; and ran his ſword through the breaſt of the Provoſt with ſuch a reſolution that he fell ſenſeleſſe at his feer. But all this audaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:170451:91"/>could not prevent <hi>Arnaldo</hi> from going to priſon: and he himſelf was alſo ſtay'd and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried by force to the Magiſtrates: To whom the fact being atteſted, they condemned him, as guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Treaſon in the perſon of a publick Officer, to loſe his head upon a Scaffold.</p>
            <p>In this ſtate of things I arrived in <hi>Eleuxis,</hi> and underſtanding the paſſages by a Gentleman my friend, at whoſe houſe I had lay'n; without ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king great thought for <hi>Arnaldo,</hi> knowing aſſured<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that the <hi>Injur'd Lover</hi> could not be guilty of ſuch a Crime: I was extreamly ſurprized, and confuſed at the name of <hi>Euriſthus;</hi> becauſe my friend repreſenting his caſe to me as of a very comely, and couragious young man, I imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly ſuſpected him to be my dear <hi>Euriſthus,</hi> husband to <hi>Orſina.</hi> I rid therefore ſtraight to the Palace, where the young man was prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring himſelf to his laſt departure, and at my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, I was permitted to ſee him: but I was ſo tranſported, that I was nearer death then he, finding him in ſo wretched a condition, upon which the laſt minutes of his life depended. On the other ſide, <hi>Euriſthus</hi> rejoyced to ſee me, and was beyond meaſure aſhamed, that I ſhould find him in that condition ſo unworthy of his gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſity: Yet having not loſt the brisk ſpirit which was ſo natural to him, I apprehended the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of his Crime, and that of a certain the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jur'd Lover</hi> was the impriſoned Knight, with the preſumptive ſtain of the murtherer of <hi>Liviana</hi>'s husband. I ran in all haſte with <hi>Euridamas,</hi> the Cavalier my friend, to the Governour, to whom having diſcloſed the quality of <hi>Arnaldo,</hi> I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:170451:91"/>him alſo to ſuſpend the execution of the ſentence of <hi>Euriſthus,</hi> for having done this in the company of a Knight of ſo high birth, and inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, his own reputation would ſuffer, both in the impriſonment, and death of his Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rade.</p>
            <p>The Governour remained exceedingly ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended at the diſcovery of <hi>Arnaldo,</hi> nor would he (at leaſt as he fained) give credit to my te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony; whereupon that I might not loſe a minute of time to <hi>Euriſthus</hi>'s prejudice, I ſhewed the Letters juſt before received from <hi>Olympia,</hi> and produced the Currier himſelf that brought them me, plainly to prove the truth of my depoſitions. And here aroſe a new mountain of difficulty, for the Governour (having begun to fear, leſt <hi>Arnaldo</hi> once got out of priſon, and gone to <hi>Boeotia,</hi> might plot ſome revenge for that injury) would not ſet him at liberty till he had firſt acquainted the Senate of <hi>Athens</hi> with theſe proceedings. I perceiving this fear of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour, took upon me, (having ſomething to loſe in the Dominion of <hi>Attica</hi>) to aſſure him of the perſon of <hi>Arnaldo,</hi> for that all the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment of his affronts falling upon his falſe accuſers; he could not with any reaſon be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grieved with the publick juſtice. This difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty being overcome, I muſt of neceſſity preſſe yet a little farther, to defer alſo the ſentence of <hi>Euriſthus,</hi> for the getting him out of all danger was almoſt impoſſible without a miracle. But ſeeing my prayers and remonſtrances profited little, I ran to the Governour's wife, a comely and diſcreet Lady, with the whom I had ſome
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:170451:92"/>years before paſt ſome ſervices in <hi>Athens;</hi> and ſo importunatly intreated her, that ſhe inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed her own authority with her husband, and obtained three dayes time of reſpit for his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prieve; for ſo much ſerved for my deſign; which was to get an order (though there was no need) from the Supream Magiſtrates of <hi>Athens</hi> to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibit all proceedings in that cauſe, and to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>journ the judging of it to the ſame Tribunal. Which done, and <hi>Euriſthus</hi> being returned to priſon, I went with the Judge Criminal to the priſon of <hi>Arnaldo,</hi> where the Cavalier being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined upon my depoſitions, and ſound inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent; the Governour commanded that he ſhould be entertained in the Palace, deſiring at his wife's inſtigation to ſatisfie with courteous treatment, that over-ſight of a conſtrained im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prudence towards him.</p>

The Governour in the mean time gave order for the apprehenſion of <hi>Liviana,</hi> as a violater of his edicts, and as a calumniator of an inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent perſon in ſo hainous a Crime; but ſhe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing pre-adviſed that a Gentleman was come to Town, that procured the liberty of <hi>Arnaldo,</hi> fled away with the Boat of <hi>Euriſthus.</hi>

            <p>This advice came to the Palace, whil'ſt we were complementing <hi>Iſabella</hi> the Governour's wife; who himſelf alſo, the more to vindicate himſelf and to agrade us, was preſent at that Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit. She took occaſion to requeſt of <hi>Arnaldo,</hi> Wherein he had angred that woman, that ſhe ſhould plot ſo enormous a treachery? To which he having modeſtly given ſatisfaction with the honeſt bluſhes of <hi>Iſabella,</hi> we paſt next to diſcourſe of <hi>Argoſthenia,</hi> and of the news of <hi>Negropont.</hi> Whereupon <hi>Iſabella,</hi> who deſired to be at <hi>Athens,</hi> for the celebration of ſome feaſts, with pretence of ſeeing <hi>Argoſthenia,</hi> of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered us with unſpeakable courteſie the ſame <hi>Feluca</hi> which ſhe had made to be prepared to do us the honour to permit us to wait on her in that voyage. Having returned the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgements due to ſo grand a favour, whil'ſt the Governour had withdrawn to give orders for the entertainment of <hi>Arnaldo:</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, ſaid I to her, the civilities we receive from you are truely worthy of an <hi>Iſabella,</hi>
               <pb n="166" facs="tcp:170451:93"/>there is onely wanting the freedom of <hi>Euri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſthus.</hi> You know Sir, ſaid <hi>Iſabella,</hi> and ſigh'd, that I have a deſire upon all occaſions to repay you the Obligations I owe you: but this is a difficult caſe, the Crime being againſt the perſon of a publick Miniſter; therefore I fear that it lieth not in my power to get him out of priſon. Alaſſe, Madam, ſaid I, it is very eaſie for you to do. Two words of yours to the Keeper, to charge him not to hinder me from viſiting him at my pleaſure, ſhall ſuffice to carry him in your <hi>Feluca</hi> to <hi>Athens.</hi> You will do ſome of your miracles, ſaid ſhe, and laughed; but have a care, The Pitcher goeth ſo oft to the Fountain that at laſt it comes broken home. Madame, ſaid I, my times are paſt: let others do what they can, for I can work no miracle. You are not to be truſted, ſaid ſhe, for your eyes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray you; But rell me a little, What courſe of life have you led ſince you left <hi>Athens?</hi> For I have heard divers relations of it; and it's re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported that being inamoured of a handſom creature of <hi>Anapliſtum,</hi> you have renounced the profeſſion which you made of a Platonick Lover, out of complacency to her corporeal beauty. I confeſſe, I gave no credit to it, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving experimented your modeſty to be greater; but yet length of time, and variety of occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences often changeth opinions; and it is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten ſeen that he that is not frolick in youth, raves in old age. I laughed, and replied. Fair and ſoftly, Madam! though ther's a few falſe witneſſes here on my head that accuſe me, I am not ſo old yet. This very thing (ſaid ſhe)
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:170451:93"/>teſtifieth againſt you; for if you count age an injury, you thereby let us know, that you are come from being a ſpirituall, to be a ſenſuall Lover: for we know very well, that Lovers of this nature, make themſelves ſeem young, leſt they ſhould be rejected. For elſe, meaſuring my age with yours, from my firſt acquaintance with you to this hour, I know you cannot be old, not having haply ſeen thirty. But this is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. Tell me, I intreat you, How this news of the Gentlewoman of <hi>Anapliſtum</hi> came up: for I have had no good ſucceſſe in defending you againſt ſome Ladyes, who abuſed me when I ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated the miracles of your modeſty.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Iſabella</hi> was ſilent, and I rejoyn'd; Madam, It was only a novelty that fame ſpread abroad by an Ignorant Amouriſt, that breaking open the ſeals of ſome Lettes which he underſtood not, interpreted them according to his ignorance, and publiſhed them conformable to his mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice. That Gentlewoman is marryed, and by this time a Mother; and I never knew her far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than to have done her ſome ſlight ſervices. <hi>Iſabella</hi> ſmiled, with a grace peculiar to her ſelf, and ſaid: You tell me ſhe is Married, and a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, (and ſo ſaying<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſhe called for her woman:) See, ſaid ſhe, that Gentlewoman now in a wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow's habit. I ſigh'd, and ſhe fell on weeping at that encounter: and I extreamly deſired to know, what croſſe wind of Fortune had diſturb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the tranquillity of her ſtate: But becauſe that was not a time for ſuch matters, I ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly had a conceit, how I might ſave <hi>Euriſthus,</hi> by her means. I therefore intreated <hi>Iſabella</hi> to
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:170451:94"/>grant her me for two hours, before her depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and I obtained her without reply: <hi>Arnal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do,</hi> and I, were invited to dinner by the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour; <hi>Iſabella</hi> exempting her ſelf, that ſhe might make ready all things for her departure, and to take care about what we had agreed upon, for the ſafety of <hi>Euriſthus.</hi> Here it was, we under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood by publick information, that the Count of <hi>Lithar,</hi> uniting the Army of the Rebells, was gone to lay ſeige to <hi>Cariſtum,</hi> to beleaguer the Dutcheſſe therein, and that ſhe had for that cauſe diſpatch't one of her Gentlemen to <hi>Athens,</hi> to demand aſſiſtance of that Republick, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the Generall at Sea was commanded to ſet ſail for that place forthwith: we took a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution, not to loſe that opportunity of ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving <hi>Arnaldo,</hi> by tranſporting our ſelves in the ſame Armado to <hi>Negropont.</hi> And in the interim he had an opportunity of ſending to <hi>Boeotia, Olym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pia</hi>'s meſſenger, with advice of his reſolutions, and to petition the King, to let his ſuccours on the other hand march to that Iſle. This being diſpatcht, we returned to the Governeſſe, to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part theſe things to her, entreating that ſhe would ſo favour us, as to accept of our ſervice. She made a civill return to our complement, ſaying, that if we would diſ-imbroyl <hi>Euriſthus,</hi> ſhe would be preſently ready in the Bark, to expect us. So I took with me <hi>Liſa</hi> the young widow, and retreated to the houſe of <hi>Euridimas,</hi> and made her to put, under her womans habit, man's aparrell, and provided my ſelf of a long mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning garment, and in this manner we came to the Priſon of <hi>Eu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="2 letters">

Being come into the Priſon, I diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt the Keeper with a formall complement, and bid her to put off her woman's weeds; with which having dreſt <hi>Euriſthus,</hi> and adviſed them both of my deſign; I held diſcourſe with a Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rade of his, to whom I promiſed (and did ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve it,) to prevail in reward of that ſervice, that <hi>Iſabella</hi> ſhould manumit him: <hi>Euriſthus</hi> went out in womans apparell, with a counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, that in the darkneſſe of ſuch obſcure dwellings, would have deceived curiouſer eyes than thoſe of a rude and ſimple guard: and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted by his Companion to the Gate, I took <hi>Liſa</hi> up under my mantle, for ſhe was ſo little, that we paſt almoſt un-diſcerned, and I went out in the obſcurity of thoſe walks very happily: But being got to the principall Gate, in the open light, and under other Sentinells, they ſaw that I walked ſlowly, and with ſome luggage under my long mantle, and began to ſuſpect ſom fraud: but not daring to open their mouths, becauſe
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:170451:95"/>
               <hi>Arnaldo</hi> and the other Cavaliers, ſtood in a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture able to terrifie more daring ſouls; they opened the Gate, out at which <hi>Euriſthus</hi> ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly leapt, <hi>ſans complement,</hi> I followed her, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conded by <hi>Arnaldo,</hi> and our other friends, with ſo much alacrity, that <hi>Liſa</hi> putting back one of her feet, falſified the ſecrecy of the Mantle. Now the Keepers plainly perceived our deſign, and having neither courage to cry out, againſt perſons of ſuch quality, nor to ſtay an hazard of being queſtioned for that eſcape; they flung away the keys, and betook themſelves to their heels; and ran faſter than we into ſome other place: For we mounting upon the Carroche of <hi>Euridamas,</hi> paſt happily to the <hi>Feluca</hi> of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verneſſe, which attended us ready to weigh Anchor.</p>
            <p>So <hi>Euriſthus</hi> being delivered, and every one fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to ſome diſcourſe or other, I would have had <hi>Liſa</hi> took her woman's cloths again; but ſhe with a comely ſmile ſaid, If that the Lady <hi>Iſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bella</hi> ſo pleaſe, ſince my Fortune hath brought me whither my election formerly led me, be you content, Sir, that I continue as I am, to accompany you to ſee the war of <hi>Negropont.</hi> And you ſhall not need to fear I ſhall want the company of women, for I will wait upon the Princeſſe <hi>Argoſthenia.</hi> Your company, ſaid I, ſince the Lady Governeſſe is ſo content, ſhall be very welcome to us, provided it be in an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance and garb, becoming your quality and my reputation. Do what you pleaſe, ſaid <hi>Iſabella,</hi> for that: I took her to be neer me for the Love of you, and to you I conſign her, now that
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:170451:95"/>ſhe is at liberty. I thanked <hi>Iſabella</hi> for her cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſy, and added;</p>
            <p>But, How came <hi>Antonello</hi> to dye ſo ſoon, ſaid I, being ſo ſprightly, and luſty? She may better tell you, (anſwered <hi>Iſabella,</hi> laughing) than I, as better acquainted with it. Yet for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, know that <hi>Antonello</hi> is dead, becauſe he was not worthy of the company of ſo handſome a maid. He was become ſo infinitely Jealous of her, that ſhe could not ſtir out of doors, to go to the Temple, nor ſo much as ſee the air at her window, without his grumbling, and bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting her. You know what is wont to happen to ſuch Animals; but the goodneſſe of <hi>Liſa,</hi> hath never deſired (though ſhe might) to pay him in the Coyn he deſerved: howbeit not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing able to live in ſo miſerable a ſlavery, ſhe found out a way to free her ſelf by placing her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in the Palace neer my perſon. Whereat <hi>Antonello</hi> took ſuch diſtaſt, and fell into ſo fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious a rage, that meeting me one day at a feaſt, he had the ſaucineſſe, to vent his reſentments publickly treating me with unworthy names. Whereby thoſe Cavaliers, at whoſe houſe the feaſt was celebrated, were ſo moved, that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der pretence of communicating ſomething to him, they drew him aſide and ſlew him, having learnt, by his death, all ſuch raſh fellows, to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the reſpect due to Ladies of my quality. In ſum, <hi>Antonello</hi> is dead, and <hi>Liſa</hi> lives ever at your diſpoſe; I having no longer any deſire of this charge, to keep her for you. Diſpoſe of her therefore at your pleaſure, ſhe being yours; but look well to it, that you provide her no
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:170451:96"/>more Jealous husbands, for I know not whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhe may be alwayes ſo good as not to deal with them according to their deſerts. The reſt of the company laughed, but <hi>Arnaldo</hi> ſighed at theſe words of <hi>Iſabella,</hi> though it was onely obſerved by my ſelf, that ſate next him, and knew the peccant humour of his profound me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholly. He asked me, Who that fair young creature was? And I ſatisfied him, that being a Noble Lady of <hi>Anapliſtum,</hi> which fell, by the death of her Parents, into a miſerable conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, I had took her into my houſe, and marryed her to a young man, well deſcended, of <hi>Eleuxis,</hi> who periſhed in the miſ-fortune re-counted by <hi>Iſabella:</hi> whereupon, he expreſt a deſire to have her go along with <hi>Argoſthenia,</hi> that ſo he might repay to her part of the obligations, which he acknowledged to my perſon. Perceiving where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at he did drive, I complyed with him, ſeeing that together with freeing him, in a great meaſure, from the inquietude of his jealouſie, I came alſo to eaſe my ſelf of the burden of farther caring for her. Anſwering, that he was her Maſter, alwayes provided that ſhe was ſatisfied; becauſe I was alwayes far from offering Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence to the liberty of another's will. In this kind of entertainment we came with a feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citous voyage to <hi>Athens;</hi> where Fortune had prepared for us a new vexation. After we had waited upon <hi>Iſabella</hi> to her houſe, we took our way towards my own; where inſtead of <hi>Argoſthenia</hi> and <hi>Methrodorus,</hi> we came to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter with the perfidious <hi>Liviana,</hi> who, without knowing who I was, had landed there
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:170451:96"/>with the <hi>Feluca,</hi> and with a Page of <hi>Euriſthus.</hi> Which Page, being brought up in my houſe, by reaſon of his new Maſters mis-fortune, was fled thither. <hi>Argoſthenia</hi> and <hi>Methrodorus,</hi> hearing by the boy of <hi>Arnaldo</hi>'s impriſonment, and the condemnation of <hi>Euriſthus,</hi> yet know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nothing of the cauſe, but onely of the death of the Provoſt; they inſtantly went for <hi>Eleuxis,</hi> to provide the beſt they could, for that occurence. But, how amazed was <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naldo</hi> and <hi>Euriſthus,</hi> when they ſaw <hi>Liviana?</hi> and how confounded was <hi>Liviana,</hi> to behold <hi>Euriſthus</hi> and <hi>Arnaldo;</hi> I leave for others to imagine. She having re-aſſum'd her baniſhed ſpirits from her ſudden fright, betook her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to my Cloſet, and haſtily ſhutting her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in, fell a plotting her own death, to free herſelf from the feared ignominy of ſome ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous puniſhment. Whereupon I, not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting any other from ſo furious a Female, knowing that <hi>Arnaldo</hi> and <hi>Euriſthus,</hi> were too generous, to ſeek to revenge themſelves upon a Woman, which, agitated by Love, or by hatred, knew not what ſhe did; entred into the Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet another way, and ſnatcht out of her hands the mortall inſtruments, which ſhe had prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to take away her life, and left her at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, to go whither ſhe would; aſſuring her upon my word, that ſhe ſhould not be preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diced in the leaſt, by her adverſaries. She be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing comforted a little by my words and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanour, entreated me to let her remain for a few dayes in that Retreat, being in great dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger if ſhe ſhould be ſeen. But being unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:170451:97"/>to incur ſuch a ſcandall, I cauſed a Bark preſently to be hired, and ſent her (<hi>Arnaldo</hi> and <hi>Euriſthus</hi> never knowing of it) the ſame night back to her confinement of <hi>Aegina;</hi> where, inſtructed by her mis-fortune, ſhe reformed the lubricity of her Genius, living and dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing (O ſtrange alteration of Heaven!) with a fame very different from that of her former life.</p>
            <p>We being in the mean time in great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certitudes, whether to return to <hi>Eleuxis,</hi> in ſearch of <hi>Argoſthenia</hi> and <hi>Methodorus,</hi> or elſe leſt we ſhould once again loſe our labours, to expect their return, or ſome advice (for they might eaſily learn there, that we were come with the Governeſſe to <hi>Athens</hi>) ſupped with much confuſion, becauſe alſo <hi>Euriſthus</hi> was not ſecure whilſt he was in <hi>Athens</hi> (howbeit he deſired to accompany us to the War of <hi>Negro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pont,</hi> we reſolved that he alſo ſhould return by Sea to <hi>Corinth,</hi> to comfort his wife with his preſence, who was diſconſolate peradventure in regard of the ſad news, which might flye thither of his death. He was no ſooner de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted, but there knockt at my Gates a ſervant of <hi>Iſabella,</hi> which preſenting me with a Note from that Lady, took his leave and went ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way.

            <p>I Valued not the deſign the Governour had to diſquiet me, and my friends, upon ſuch a quarrel; having power in my hands to make all his attempts that way to vaniſh into ſmoke. But that which did extreamly trouble me, was, that <hi>Iſabella</hi> might hereby be a ſufferer, to whom profeſſing ſo many ſingular Obligations, it was my duty to remove from her any thing that might occaſion her diſcontent. I made uſe therefore of this occaſion to leave <hi>Athens</hi> once again, and participated my deſigns to <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naldo,</hi> beſeeching him to ſtay in my houſe with <hi>Liſa,</hi> to expect <hi>Argoſthenia</hi> and <hi>Methrodorus,</hi> or ſome news from them before that he did
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:170451:98"/>reſolve on any thing. <hi>Arnaldo</hi> would by no means permit that I ſhould go alone; but I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing glad that I had encountred an opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity convenient for the purſuit of my intent of traverſing the World, and compliance with my humour of travail, reſolved to leave <hi>Athens</hi> before morning, being wafted over by a very ſwift little Bark to <hi>Eleuxis;</hi> where providing all things neceſſary for the intereſts of my friends, and informing my ſelf of <hi>Argoſthenia</hi> and <hi>Methrodorus,</hi> and having heard that being deceived by a falſe report, that <hi>Arnaldo</hi> and I had ſet ſayl on our way for <hi>Thebes,</hi> they were gone thither; I took with me <hi>Euridamas</hi> being well practiſed in that courſe, and put my ſelf in purſuit of them with ſuch ſpeed, that we over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took them upon the Banks of the (to <hi>Argo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſthenia</hi>) ſo fatal <hi>Aſopos;</hi> with what reſentments of the Lady, may be eaſlyer imagined than de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed. She wept a great while for joy, and ſeeing her to trouble her content with condo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the many malitious fortunes which ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated her from <hi>Arnaldo,</hi> I took occaſion to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert her thoughts unto more ſublime appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions, perſwading her to go preſently for <hi>Calcides. Methrodorus</hi> feared ſuch dangerous counſel, for that the Citie being in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels hands, it would be to precipitate her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the jaws of deſtruction. But revolving in my head a conſideration of State, upon which the fortune of the Lady and of <hi>Arnaldo</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended, I perſiſted ſtill in this reſolution, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadging, that there was no way ſo ſecure, not ſo facile as this to enſtate <hi>Argoſthenia</hi> in that
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:170451:98"/>Grandure, to which her birth and deſtiny gave her juſt pretenſions. <hi>Methrodorus</hi> and <hi>Euri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damas</hi> deſired me, that, to encourage them to accompany me in ſo hazardous a ſervice, I would declare to them the ſecrets of my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figne. But I would not diſcover my ſelf in a thing that depended more upon events than upon diſcourſe; telling them, that if they thought the enterpriſe deſperate and perillous, they might ſtay at <hi>Arclides</hi> to be ſpectators, and I would go with <hi>Argoſthenia,</hi> her woman, and onely one Page, to <hi>Calcides.</hi> They would not conſent to that, alledging that being my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions, in the voyage, and in the ſervice of <hi>Argoſthenia,</hi> they would alſo partake with me in the hazzard, and in the glory of ſo ſtrange an adventure. This being concluded on, and, giving the name of <hi>Erintha</hi> to <hi>Argoſthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,</hi> I called my ſelf <hi>Polydamas,</hi> a Knight of <hi>Corcira,</hi> and gave out, that, being baniſhed for a matter of honour by the Prince of <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus,</hi> I was come into thoſe parts to ſeek my fortune. <hi>Euridamas,</hi> and <hi>Methrodorus</hi> put them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves into the diſguiſe, this of Uſher to <hi>Argo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſthenia,</hi> that of Gentleman of my Chamber; And I ſent two ſervants belonging to thoſe Knights (for that we would not have ſuch mean perſons about us in a buſineſſe of that moment) to wait our pleaſures at <hi>Arclides:</hi> and ſo we travailed by Land to <hi>Calcides:</hi> where, learning by the common vogue of the people, that the Count of <hi>Lythar,</hi> proceeded vigorouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the ſiege of <hi>Cariſtum</hi> to reduce it, before the <hi>Athenian</hi> Armado ſhould relieve it; and

            <p>HAving written this Letter, and informed <hi>Euridamas</hi> of my thoughts, I ſent him to preſent it to the Counteſſe, together with a Necklace of Turchoiſes, wrought in Gold, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed by <hi>Argoſthenia</hi> in her idleneſſe at <hi>Athens.</hi> The quality of the preſent, more than the ſtyle of my Letter, and the curioſity together of ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my preſumed wife, which <hi>Euridamas</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended for the moſt beautifull Creature in the World, eaſily perſwaded the Counteſſe to grant me more than my requeſt, making us an offer of her own Palace, till ſuch time as we were provided with Lodgings. But being unwilling to engage my ſelf, I took the firſt empty houſe, which I ſtumbled upon, and ſhut my ſelf up in it, and that night went with <hi>Argoſthenia</hi> to the Palace; not only to complement with the Count and Counteſſe, but to obſerve their proceedings, and the manner and quality of their Attendants. The Careſſes which the Counteſſe gave us, (de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring perhaps to get ſome other preſent out of us), were indeed without meaſure, and yet with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:170451:100"/>the leaſt affectation, for that ſhe was a Lady truely ſprightly, vivacious, and magnanimous. This foundation being laid, and having for ever captivated the heart of the Counteſſe to favour us; I advertiſed <hi>Methrodorus</hi> that he ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin by little and little to diſcover himſelf to his Kindred, Friends, and Allies, which he knew diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſted the preſent Government; ye<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> declaring he was arrived at <hi>Calcides,</hi> upon aſſurance of the fall of the Royal family which had ſo perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them. With this diligence we collected in a few dayes twelve Cavaliers of the Prime of the Nobility of <hi>Negropont:</hi> ſome of which, though diſſatisfied with the Dutcheſſe and the Princes paſt; yet would not admit to be governed by perſons whom they had converſed with as equals in Fortune, and whom they had treated as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriours in Nobility. We could eaſily have muſtered a far greater number; but fearing by delay to give fortune an occaſion of diſcovering ſomething of theſe agitations; and doubting that in a greater number ſuch a ſecret might be endangered; we ſummoned them every one to meet at an hour unobſerved in my houſe; and having taken of them a ſolemne Oath towards the Dutcheſſe their legitimate Lady, for whoſe ſervice I had gathered them together in that aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly, I began in this manner reſolutely to ſpeak.</p>
            <p>
               <q>My Lords, I ſuppoſe that you have alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy underſtood by <hi>Methrodorus</hi> your good Friend and Kinſman, to what end you were called hither, which is to conſult of the way to eject the Rebels, and Tyrants from this Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:170451:100"/>and to put it into the hands of the Dutcheſſe <hi>Doricinia,</hi> to whom by right of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mogeniture, and by your election, you be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged in a perpetual obedience and fidelity. I know you think it ſtrange, that I, being a young man, and a ſtranger, ſhould upon my own motion venture my ſelf, and incite you to an Enterprize of ſo much difficulty, and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; But I ſhall not be the firſt among men, which although a weak inſtrument my ſelf, have been able to give a motion to grand ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chinations. But, though others moved by co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetouſneſſe, have attempted enterprizes above their fortune; I may be thought to be come to this reſolution by the onely impulſe of Juſtice, Friendſhip, and Love. She, My Lords, which here you behold with the name of <hi>Erintha,</hi> and in the appearance of my wife, is <hi>Argoſthenia,</hi> a noble branch of the Royal Stem of your Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, to whom, after the Dutcheſſe your Miſtreſs, diſcends the inheritance of this moſt flouriſhing Principality. Nor is ſhe my wife, but my Lady by merit, and Siſter by fortune: and is indeed lawfull Spouſe of <hi>Arnaldo,</hi> a noble perſon of the Royal Line of <hi>Thebes,</hi> which is ready to come in a few hours with the Armado of the Republick of <hi>Athens</hi> in relief of the Dutch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſſe. There will not be wanting neither, on the other ſide, the ſuccours of the <hi>Theban</hi> King, who ſtayes but for our notice, to haſte over with his Forces to theſe parts. But if it be lawfull for me freely to declare my thoughts; I do not at all like theſe Auxiliaries, becauſe I am afraid it is but the taking a Serpent into our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome,
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:170451:101"/>to our ſuppreſſion, rather than relief. For, if that Commonwealth, and this King, make themſelves Maſters of the ſtrongeſt pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of this Dukedom, to which they have ſo antient and ſo ſtrong pretenſions; I know not when they will be content to reſign them willingly; (<hi>Princes never wanting pretexts, to uſurp, and detain the poſſeſſion of other States;)</hi> And, to compell them by force, we ſhall be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes too weak of our ſelves; and to call other Princes to our aſſiſtance, would be an opening the ſluces to our totall inundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, changing this Country into a ſeat of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall War, for ſtrangers, to conſume our wealth, annihilate our families, violate our honours, and to impoſe reduplicated chains of vaſſallage, upon this, at yet, free Principali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. I would adviſe therefore, that with Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, and Reſolutions, worthy of generous Knights, and Loyall Subjects, we do at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt with our own hands, to re-eſtabliſh the Crown of this Dominion, upon the heads of our legitimate Princes and Maſters. Nor is this ſo difficult a matter to effect, if it be well managed. Reſolve therefore to acknowledge for your Princeſſe (with a <hi>Salvo</hi> alwayes to the right of the Dutcheſſe our Miſtreſſe) <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goſt henia,</hi> and to unite your ſelves for her, in this teſtimony of fidelity; and hereafter, we ſhall not want either time or occaſion to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult the manner alſo of turning the Rebells out of the City, to eſtabliſh her in the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of her lawfull Dominions.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Thoſe Cavaliers for a good ſpace ſtood aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed,
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:170451:101"/>by the unexpected coming of <hi>Argoſthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,</hi> and by ſuch an attempt of a young Knight, alone, and ſurrounded by a City of Enemies. But afterwards certified by <hi>Methrodorus,</hi> and by their own eyes (which diſcerned in the face of <hi>ArgOſthenia,</hi> the features of <hi>Doricinia,</hi> and her deceaſed brothers) of the truth of her per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; and encouraged alſo by the reherſall of the adventures ſhe had happily gone through, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der my conduct, and of her Contract with <hi>Arnaldo,</hi> they ranne all to kiſſe her hand, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing her (after the Dutcheſſe) for their Lady; and diſpoſed themſelves in every parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, to follow my directions. Hereupon, I loſt no time, but deſiring ſome of them to ſtay in that houſe, till the contrived Deſign had taken effect, I thus continued to ſpeak to them.</p>
            <p>
               <q>My Lords: This is my deſign; And he that hath any better way, let him ſpeak, and procure the publick and private benefit of his Country, of his Prince, and of himſelf. You ſhall, if you pleaſe, take a rude ſupper with me, to ſtay hid till my deſigns be ripe, to lead you elſewhere. In the interim, I will ſend <hi>Euri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damas</hi> to intreat the Counteſſe to ſup to night with my wife, deſiring to impart ſome matters of concernment to her, out of the noiſe of the Palace. I am confident ſhe will come preſently, out of a deſire to get ſome Preſent out of us, having an opinion, that we are exceeding rich in Jewells. When ſhe comes, we will ſecure her attendants, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn with her and <hi>Argoſthenia</hi> to the Palace;
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:170451:102"/>of the which having made our ſelves Maſters, with the impriſonment (if he will not freely ſurrender himſelf) of the Count Governour, we will proceed with his Orders and Signalls, to ſeiſe the Market-place, and the Port, without noiſe or blood. And this I aſſure you, my Lords, on the word of a Gentleman, (which is the onely recompence of merit, which myperills and counſells may acquire me) that there ſhall not be ſpilt the blood of any Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, although a Rebell; nor of any Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, although an Enemy; except it be in our neceſſary defence. I onely ſhall ask, that the Count and Counteſſe Governours, may be left to my protection, to whom beeing other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes obliged, and drawing the Counteſſe to my houſe, I deſire and entreat the Princeſſe <hi>Argoſthenia</hi> to ingage, that ſhe will never here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after on any occaſion, or under any pretence, puniſh them for this default of the Rebellion of the Count of <hi>Lythar</hi> their brother.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Having thus ſaid, and having received from the Princeſſe and Lords, their Word and Oath; and having left them in an unobſerved place of the houſe, I immediately diſpatcht <hi>Eurida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas</hi> to invite the Counteſſe to Supper; who failed not to come a while after, with a very ſlender retinue. We ſupt reaſonable well; and foraſmuch as being diſcompoſed with the plots in my head, I was ever and anon ſilent and penſive, and ſometimes beholding her with much attention, ſhe entred into a ſuſpition of me, as if I contemplated her out of a liking of her beauty; and began to obſerve my face, and
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:170451:102"/>behaviour, and remained a little ſuſpended and changed. But ſupper was hardly done, when I was informed by <hi>Methrodorus</hi> and <hi>Euri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damas,</hi> that they had, in a pretence to entertain them, carryed the Attendants of the Counteſſe into a place whence they could not ſtir, and that the Confederated Lords were in a poſture ready to march to the Palace. I ſtarted up, and, with a countenance between merry and ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; Gentle Madam (ſaid I) <q>It ſenſibly agrieves me, to ſtain the mirth of the Table of hoſpitality, with a neceſſitated incivility towards you; but becauſe I am more obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to <hi>Argoſthenia</hi> your Princeſſe, and my La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, than to the courteſies received from your urbanity, I beſeech you pardon the errour, that, with reaſon, I commit againſt Reaſon. Madam, you are my priſoner, and all that I can comply in to your Merits, and my Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations is, to aſſure you, in the name of this your Princeſſe, and my Miſtreſſe, your life, honour, and eſtate. Be pleaſed therefore to change your title of Governeſſe of <hi>Calcides,</hi> into that of a Subject and Servant of <hi>Doricinia</hi> and <hi>Argoſthenia,</hi> and to remain in my cuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, not ſtirring a ſtep from me; for if you ſtir, and receive ſome affront, I have diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged my ſelf, having already ſatisfied the debts of Friendſhip and Honour, not onely in adviſing you, but in preſerving all that <hi>which you ought in juſtice to loſe, as of courſe, with your Husband, guilty of a High treaſon, impardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable upon any other account,</hi> unleſſe that of the unparallel'd <hi>Clemency</hi> of this generous Princeſſe.</q>
            </p>
            <pb n="186" facs="tcp:170451:103"/>
            <p>That the Counteſſe remain'd aſtoniſhed with ſuch a change of Scenes in the Theater of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, queſtionleſſe is not to be doubted; She would at firſt have ſhewed her reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and have cryed out to her ſervants; but ſeeing the confederate Lords to enter the room armed at all poynts, ſhe now requeſted, what I had formerly voluntarily proffered, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve her honour, eſtate; and life. Then I lead her, and <hi>Argoſthenia,</hi> into her own Coach, and made ſome of the Lord's ſervants, to put on the Liveries of her Pages, and Lacquyes, who had already rallyed a great number of friends and Complices, going in this poſture qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etly, till we came to the Palace; giving her in the mean time, particular information of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goſthenia,</hi> and of that affaire; that ſhe might Cancell her former crimes, by her preſent good ſervice, co-operating (herſelf) to the <hi>ſetle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the State, in reducing it to the obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of it's legitimate Governours.</hi> The Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſſe (as ſhe ſaid, being obliged with ſuch modeſty and courteous treatment,) offered her ſelf to do miracles in this particular, ſeeing no ſini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter adventure of Fortune obſtructed her.</p>
            <p>Being brought with ſuch like diſcourſe to the Palace, and having deluded the guards, by firſt dividing them by her order, and then they being made to diſ-arm by the Servants of the Lords, we aſcended to the uper appartements (poſſeſſing our ſelves of all the poſts as we went) and into her own Chamber, where her Husband was expecting her to go to bed.</p>
            <p>But, ſeeing me appear with her, and <hi>Argo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſthenia,
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:170451:103"/>Methrodorus, Euridamas,</hi> and the other Lords, in no peaceable poſture, he would have cried out, and have called his Gentlemen and Guards to help him.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Then the Counteſſe, ſtepping out before the reſt, ſaid, My Lord, you alſo muſt acknowledge <hi>Argoſthenia</hi> for your Princeſſe and Lady, and put your ſelf, as I have done, under the prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of this Knight, or reſolve to die preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly without any remiſſion. <hi>Theſe uſurped Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dures, as unfit for us, are ſoon vaniſhed:</hi> It re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains that we ſubmit with patience and fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, thereby to deſerve the favours we have already obtained of pardon for our Crimes; with the ſafety of our lives, riches, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours.</q> Surrender therefore to this Lady, who is your Princeſſe <hi>Argoſthenia,</hi> your pretenſions of Command, and the Signals for the poſſeſſion of the Port and Fleet. She is Miſtreſſe, and you are no longer Governour of <hi>Calcides.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He being in part ſatisfied with theſe Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrances of the Counteſſe, the abſolute con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouler of his heart, and regulator of his affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, did all that we deſired: and we inſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly committed the charge to the Lords our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federates, recommending to <hi>Euridamas</hi> the Guard of the Palace to <hi>Methrodorus</hi> that of the <hi>Piazza,</hi> or Market-place; to the <hi>Count</hi> of <hi>Armenum</hi> the inveſting of the Port, to the <hi>Count</hi> of <hi>Lagia</hi> of the Fleet, and to other Lords and Knights other Charges, according to their merits and capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cities. There were likewiſe called to the Palace the old ſervants of the Dutcheſſe, which had ſtay'd at <hi>Calcides;</hi> but I my ſelf ſtirr'd not from
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:170451:104"/>the Princeſſe's ſide, not to confound the orders, which depended on my direction, and to look to the perſons of the Count and Counteſſe, and get out of them ſuch things as were neceſſary to be known for the regulating my actions in the preſent conjunctures.</p>
            <p>The night being thus ſpent without ſleep, the morning following, all that vaſt Citie beheld it ſelf recovered out of the hands of the Rebels, without the loſſe of any man, except one onely Captain, and a few Souldiers of a <hi>Corps du guard:</hi> which would have refuſed obedience to the Count of <hi>Armenum.</hi> Day being come, all the Nobility and Citizens repaired to the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace to do Homage to <hi>Argoſthenia,</hi> and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand the death of the Governour and his fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers, for an expiation of that Rebellion. And ſeeing the old Counſellours of the Dutcheſſe, and the other Miniſters of State adviſed that they ſhould be delivered, notwithſtanding the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe's Oath, that ſo the people might not be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied that ſatisfaction, which might be a means to make them the more reſolute in defending themſelves againſt the Count of <hi>Lytharre,</hi> when he ſhould march thither with his Army to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge them; and being unwilling that my faith ſhould be broken, I carried the Count and Counteſſe with the Princeſſe's permiſſion ſecret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to my houſe, and there diſguiſing them in Lacquyes apparel, got them ſafe out of <hi>Calci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des.</hi> Then afterwards leaving the Princeſſe's in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions in writing for the perfecting the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of the work begun, and bidding <hi>Adieu</hi> to the Cavaliers, my friends, I got <hi>incognitò</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:170451:104"/>a very expeditious Bark, and hoiſted ſayl for <hi>Athens,</hi> to bring in perſon the firſt news of theſe Revolutions to <hi>Arnaldo.</hi> Who ſtanding a long while aſtoniſhed thereat, as at a thing he eſteemed impoſſible; in the end threw himſelf about my neck with large acknowledgements of infinite Obligations, and would have carried me back to <hi>Calcides,</hi> with large promiſes of ſharing his fortunes with me. <hi>Argoſthenia</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred in the ſame inſtances with reduplicated Letters, and re-iterated Ambaſſages: but being content in having ſatisfied my Obligations of friendſhip to <hi>Arnaldo,</hi> and of brotherhood with <hi>Argoſthenia,</hi> I would not again leave the doors of my own houſe, to hazard my ſelf in the Tempeſts of the Court. And ſo having recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended to them both, <hi>Euridamas, Methrodorus,</hi> and <hi>Liſa,</hi> who merited their eſteem, I continued conſtant in the quietude and tranquillity of my mind and fortune: howbeit, I was very much troubled in the paſſions of my Soul, for the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timely, and much to be lamented deaths, which a little after hapned to <hi>Iſabella,</hi> for whom I had already ſuffered ſo much in the Kingdom of Love and Fortune; and likewiſe of the Count of <hi>Olarita,</hi> now become my moſt Cordial friend; which left me heir of a great trouble, with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commending to me in the place of Siſter, the fair, and ſprightfull Counteſſe his Conſort.</p>
            <p>How afterwards <hi>Arnaldo</hi> went to <hi>Calcides,</hi> how he was acknowledged for husband of <hi>Argo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſthenia,</hi> how he rallied a potent Army of faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ſubjects, and adventurous Souldiers; How he relieved the Dutcheſſe, overthrew in battle
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:170451:105"/>the Count of <hi>Lytharre,</hi> who fled, and ended his dayes at <hi>Byzantium;</hi> And how the Dutcheſſe being returned to <hi>Calcides,</hi> confirmed <hi>Argoſthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,</hi> after a ſolemn Marriage, in the Dignity of Hereditary Princeſſe, with the other Adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of theſe married Princes; Some more for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate Pen than ours, will perhaps give no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice to the World; here being concluded th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
